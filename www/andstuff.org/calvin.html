<h1>CALVIN&rsquo;S COVENANTAL RESPONSE<br>
TO THE ANABAPTIST VIEW OF BAPTISM</h1>

<address>Peter A. Lillback</address>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class="non-indent">ALTHOUGH many baptistic theologians drink deeply from the
well of Calvin&rsquo;s theology, his doctrine of infant baptism is deemed to be
at best unpalatable, at worst poisonous.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a>
It is considered one of the unfortunate carryovers of Romish doctrine in the
Reformers&rsquo; thought.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a>
Consequently, the baptists and those who hold a baptistic view of baptism see
themselves as the completion of <span class="page">[p. 186]</span> the Reformation begun by Luther and advanced by
Calvin.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a>
Calvinistic Baptists believe that no great injustice is done to Calvin&rsquo;s
<span class="page">[p. 187]</span> system by discarding this one
doctrine.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a>
It is normally thought that Calvin&rsquo;s penetrating insights into the
doctrine of Scripture, the mediatorial work of Christ, justification, and
eternal life are entirely independent of the baptism question. While this
attitude is understandable, it raises the important question of whether Calvin
himself perceived the significance of baptism in such a narrow and independent
fashion.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Calvin&rsquo;s conception of the relationship of
baptism to other important doctrines of Scripture is not difficult to
ascertain. The reason for this is found in his very detailed and lengthy
response to the theology that developed from the Radical Reformers. In a
passage from his discussion of infant baptism, Calvin assails the Anabaptists
and others of similar conviction by claiming that their rejection of the
equation of infant baptism and circumcision results in a horrible corruption
of Scripture. Calvin exclaims:</p>

  <blockquote>Now let us examine the arguments by which certain mad beasts
  ceaselessly assail this holy institution of God. First of all, since they
  feel that they are immoderately cramped and constrained by the likeness
  between baptism and circumcision, they strive to set these two things apart
  by a wide difference so that there may seem to be nothing in common between
  them. For they say that these two signify different things, that the
  covenant in each is quite different, and the calling of children under each
  is not the same. . . In asserting a difference between the covenants, with
  what barbarous boldness do they dissipate and corrupt Scripture! And not in
  one passage only &mdash; but so as to leave nothing safe or untouched! For
  they depict the Jews to us as so carnal that they are more like beasts than
  men. A covenant with them would not <span class="page">[p. 188]</span> go
  beyond the temporal life, and the promises given them would rest in present
  and physical benefits. If this doctrine should obtain, what would remain save
  that the Jewish nation was satiated for a time with God&rsquo;s benefits (as
  men fatten a herd of swine in a sty), only to perish in eternal destruction?
  (IV. 16. 10)<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"
  title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a></blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">While Calvin&rsquo;s invective strikes the modern reader
as extreme, it nonetheless indicates Calvin&rsquo;s deep feelings on the issue.
But more importantly, it must be noticed that Calvin&rsquo;s concern is not
simply for the sacrament of infant baptism, but for what he felt to be the
inherent and inevitable danger to all of Scriptural doctrine if the Anabaptist
argument was to be accepted.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"
title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a>
If infant baptism is to be overturned, then the continuity of the Old Covenant
with the New Covenant must be denied. But to do this, Calvin argues, is to make
the Old Testament saints nothing more than recipients of material blessings
from God at the expense of their salvation.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"
title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> In light of this,
<span class="page">[p. 189]</span> one can see why Calvin did not view
paedobaptism in a narrow
class by itself, but instead as an important safeguard of Scripture and
doctrine. To affirm infant baptism meant that one saw the unity of the Bible
and consequently its constant theme of redemptive history. In other words,
infant baptism was covenantal for Calvin, and since so many other doctrines of
Scripture were related to the covenant, to deny the sacrament meant that other
central truths were in jeopardy as well. It is clear, then, that Calvin would
not agree with those who claim that they do little harm to his system by simply
excising paedobaptism. To deny infant baptism is to deny the covenant, and so
to put the other doctrines of Scripture in danger. As one explores
Calvin&rsquo;s thought with respect to the covenant, he is immediately struck
with the numerous points of doctrine that he intimately couples with
it.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a> In this way,
Calvin demonstrates the danger to all doctrine by the Anabaptist approach.</p>

<span class="page">[p. 190]</span>

<h2>I. Calvin&rsquo;s Argument for the Continuity of Doctrine<br>
in the Old and New Covenants</h2>

<p>Calvin&rsquo;s fundamental proposition in his argument for the continuity
of the covenants is that God always covenanted His people to Himself
by the same law and doctrine. Thus he writes,</p>

  <blockquote>. . . all men adopted by God into the company of his people
  since the beginning of the world were covenanted to him by the same law and
  by the bond of the same doctrine as obtains among us.
  (II. 10. 1)<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"
  title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a></blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Similarly he states, &ldquo;The covenant made with all
the patriarchs is so much like ours in substance and reality that the two are
actually one and the same. Yet they differ in the mode of dispensation&rdquo;
(II. 10. 2). Not even the Mosaic legal system can be seen to be without its
necessary conjunction with the one divine covenant,</p>

  <blockquote>I understand by the word &ldquo;law&rdquo; not only the Ten
  Commandments, which set forth a godly and righteous rule of living, but the
  form of religion handed down by God through Moses. And Moses was not made a
  lawgiver to wipe out the blessing promised to the race of Abraham. Rather, we
  see him repeatedly reminding the Jews of that freely given covenant made with
  their fathers of which they were the heirs. It was as if he were sent to
  renew it. This fact was very clearly revealed in the ceremonies.
  (II. 7. 1)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Calvin beautifully portrays his understanding of the
single covenant of God in its different administrations in terms of
progressive redemptive history,</p>

<span class="page">[p. 191]</span>

  <blockquote>The Lord held to this orderly plan in administering the
  covenant of his mercy: as the day of full revelation approached with the
  passing of time, the more he increased each day the brightness of its
  manifestation. Accordingly, at the beginning when the first promise of
  salvation was given to Adam it glowed like a feeble spark. Then, as it was
  added to, the light grew in fullness, breaking forth increasingly and
  shedding its radiance more widely. At last &mdash; when all the clouds were
  dispersed &mdash; Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, fully illumined the
  whole earth. (II. 10. 20)<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"
  title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>Since all of God&rsquo;s people have enjoyed the same law and
doctrine albeit in different degrees of revelation and varying administration,
it follows that they have always known Christ as Mediator. Speaking of the Old
Covenant saints, Calvin says, &ldquo;. . . they had and knew Christ as
Mediator, through whom they were joined to God and were to share in his
promises&rdquo; (II. 10. 2). Again he asserts, &ldquo;There are two remaining
points: that the Old Testament fathers (1) had Christ as pledge of their
covenant, and (2) put in him all trust of future blessedness&rdquo;
(II. 10. 23). And if the Old Covenant was blessed with Christ, it is just as
certain that they also possessed the grace of justification.<a href="#_ftn11"
name="_ftnref11" title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a> So Calvin argues,</p>

  <blockquote>For the same reason it follows that the Old Testament was
  established upon the free mercy of God, and was confirmed by Christ&rsquo;s
  intercession. For the gospel preaching, too, declares nothing else than that
  sinners are justified apart from their own merit by God&rsquo;s fatherly
  kindness; and the whole of it summed up in Christ. Who, then, dares to
  separate the Jews from Christ, since with them, we hear, was made the
  covenant of the gospel, the sole foundation of which is Christ?
  (II. 10. 4)</blockquote>

<p>But if the grace of the covenant was equal in the Old Covenant era to that
of the New Covenant era, then the sacraments must also have equal significance
in both eras. Calvin contends that Paul held this,</p>

<span class="page">[p. 192]</span>

  <blockquote>Indeed, the apostle makes the Israelites equal to us not only in
  the grace of the covenant but also in the signification of the sacraments.
  In recounting examples of the punishments with which, according to Scripture,
  the Israelites were chastised of old, his purpose was to deter the
  Corinthians from falling into similar misdeeds. So he begins with this
  premise: there is no reason why we should claim any privilege for ourselves,
  to deliver us from the vengeance of God, which they underwent, since the
  Lord not only provided them with the same benefits but also manifested his
  grace among them by the same symbols. (II. 10. 5)</blockquote>

<p>Because the Word of God was present in the Old Covenant, eternal life was
also a key blessing of the covenant that the Old Covenant saints
shared with the New Covenant believers,</p>

  <blockquote>. . . the spiritual covenant was also common to the patriarchs.
  . . . Now since God of old bound the Jews to himself by this sacred bond,
  there is no doubt that he set them apart to the hope of eternal life. . . .
  Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham and other patriarchs cleaved to God by such
  illumination of the Word. Therefore I say that without any doubt they
  entered into God&rsquo;s immortal kingdom. For theirs was a real
  participation in God, which cannot be without the blessing of eternal life.
  (II. 10. 7)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">The very formula of the covenant which was possessed by
the Old Testament saints for Calvin demanded that they be seen to be possessors
of eternal life.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"
title=""><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <blockquote>. . . let us pass on to the very formula of the covenant. .  . .
  For the Lord always covenanted with his servants thus: &ldquo;I will be your
  God, and you shall be my people.&rdquo; The prophets also commonly explained
  that life and salvation and the whole of blessedness are embraced in these
  words. . . He is our God on this condition: that he dwell among us, as he
  has testified through Moses. But one cannot obtain such a presence of him
  without, at the same time, possessing life. And although nothing further was
  expressed, they had a clear enough promise of spiritual life in these words:
  &ldquo;I am . . . your God.&rdquo; For he did not declare that he would be a
  God to their bodies alone, but especially to their souls. Still souls, unless
  they be joined to God through righteousness, remain estranged from him in
  death. On the other hand, such a union when present will bring everlasting
  salvation with it. (II. 10. 8)</blockquote>

<span class="page">[p. 193]</span>

<p class="non-indent">A little later, Calvin repeats this same point more
briefly,</p>

  <blockquote>. . . the Old Testament or Covenant that the Lord had made
  with the Israelites had not been limited to earthly things, but contained a
  promise of spiritual and eternal life. The expectation of this must have been
  impressed upon the hearts of all who truly consented to the covenant.
  (II. 10. 23)</blockquote>

<p>In light of all this evidence Calvin believes that he has established the
spirituality of the covenant of the Old Testament saints, and hence its
continuity with the New Covenant. He concludes, &ldquo;Yet unless we shun the
proffered light, we already possess a clear affirmation of the spiritual
covenant&rdquo; (II. 10. 5). Again, he concludes,</p>

  <blockquote>Therefore, when we hear the public oracles of the Holy
  Spirit, in which he so clearly and plainly discussed spiritual life in the
  church of the Jews, it would be intolerable stubbornness to relegate them
  solely to a carnal covenant, wherein mention is made only of the earth and
  of earthly riches. (II. 10. 19)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">At this point, one can begin to understand Calvin&rsquo;s
vehement assault on the Anabaptist rejection of infant baptism. Since this
rejection demanded that the Old Testament covenant be made into a material or
carnal covenant &mdash; circumcision was not a spiritual symbol &mdash; several
important doctrines associated with the covenant were as a result severely
injured. If the Anabaptist basis for rejecting infant baptism prevailed, then
there would be no Old Testament progressive revelation and preparation for the
Messiah. Since the Old Testament covenant was only material, Christ would be
never present before them, and so God would in essence have mocked them by
withholding salvation from them. Just as serious, there would have been no
Old Testament counterpart of the grace of justification which was founded upon
Christ. If such a carnal covenant were correct, Paul&rsquo;s argument on the
example of Israel&rsquo;s punishment for disobedience supported by the equality
of sacraments of the Old and New Covenants would be utterly in error. And every
bit as unthinkable, the Word of God present in the covenant formula would be
severed from eternal life. It is because of these resulting errors that Calvin
can speak of infant baptism as a safeguard of Scripture and doctrine. If it is
taught, the continuity of Scripture in the one divine covenant of grace is
affirmed. For Calvin, there is one covenant which is constant throughout
Scripture. To reject infant baptism is to deny the unity of the covenant and
thus to result in such confusion.</p>

<span class="page">[p. 194]</span>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that no contemporary baptist would be willing to make
the kind of affirmations that Calvin is refuting. Nevertheless, a serious
inconsistency remains.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"
title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a> If the Old Covenant was in fact a history of
redemption, with Christ as Mediator being gradually revealed, Who was the
ground of the Old Covenant saints&rsquo; justification, and Whose Word was
truly present, how could the sacraments not be spiritual as well? Yet baptists
of all varieties reject the equation of circumcision and infant baptism by
asserting that circumcision was really a material&ndash;political sign, not
primarily a spiritual sign as New Covenant baptism. If they agree with Calvin
at the first points, it is impossible not to agree with Calvin at the last
point of the spirituality of the covenantal sign of circumcision and remain
consistent.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a>
And if this is granted, Calvin will argue, there is nothing that prevents the
New Covenant believer from also claiming <span class="page">[p. 195]</span> the
same promise by the spiritual sacrament of infant baptism that the Old Covenant
believer claimed in the spiritual sacrament of infant circumcision.</p>

<h2>II. Calvin&rsquo;s Explanation of the Differences Between the
Covenants:<br>
The Relationship of Law to Gospel and Letter to Spirit</h2>

<p>Having argued ardently for the essential unity of the Old
and New Covenants, Calvin is conscious that his opponents can charge him with
failing to come to grips with the numerous biblical testimonies to the
differences between them. To this matter he next turns his attention,</p>

<span class="page">[p. 196]</span>

  <blockquote>What then? You will ask: will no difference remain between
  the Old and New Testaments? What is to become of the many passages of
  Scripture wherein they are contrasted as utterly different? I freely admit
  the differences in Scripture, to which attention is called, but in such a
  way as not to detract from its established unity. (II. 11. 1)</blockquote>

<p>Calvin enumerates five differences between the covenants, each of which is
related only to the externals of the covenant and not to its substance.  The
<em>first</em> is that the Old Covenant used material or temporal blessings
to represent spiritual blessings, while New Covenant members meditate upon
these spiritual blessings directly.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"
title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a> Although affirming this, Calvin distances himself
from the materialistic covenant idea of the Old Covenant with no uncertain
terms,</p>

  <blockquote>The point of our quarrel with men of this sort is this: they
  teach that the Israelites deemed the possession of the Land of Canaan their
  highest and ultimate blessedness, and that after the revelation of Christ it
  typified for us the heavenly inheritance. We contend, on the contrary, that,
  in the earthly possession they enjoyed, they looked, as in a mirror, upon
  the future inheritance they believed to have been prepared for them in
  heaven. (II. 11. 1)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Calvin perceives this difference as one of divine
dispensation that is explained simply by God&rsquo;s own will,</p>

  <blockquote>But we shall readily dispose of these misgivings if we turn
  our attention to this dispensation of God which I have noted. He willed
  that, for the time during which he gave his covenant to the people of Israel
  in a veiled form, be grace of future and eternal happiness be signified and
  figured under earthly benefits, the gravity of spiritual death under
  physical punishments. (II. 11. 3)</blockquote>

<p>The next three differences Calvin summarizes as the differences between the
law and gospel (<em>cf.</em> II. 11. 10). In this context, Old Testament means
&ldquo;law&rdquo; and New Testament means &ldquo;gospel.&rdquo; The
<em>second</em> difference between the covenants, and the first in this
category, is that truth in the Old Testament was conveyed by images and
ceremonies as types of Christ, while the New Covenant has the benefit of
having the full revelation of Christ&rsquo;s incarnation. Calvin depicts this
difference this way,</p>

  <blockquote>The second difference between the Old and New Testaments
  consists <span class="page">[p. 197]</span> in figures: that, in the absence
  of the reality, it showed but an image and shadow in place of the substance;
  the New Testament reveals the very substance of truth as present.
  (II. 11. 4)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">But while Calvin appears to be making a distinction
between the two covenants with respect to substance due to the presence and
absence of the reality, he shortly clarifies himself. The difference is with
respect to promise and fulfillment, or viewing Christ from the standpoint of
His first advent that was future in the Old Covenant or from the New Covenant
where His coming as man is past. Calvin explains,</p>

  <blockquote>Here we are to observe how the covenant of the law compares with
  the covenant of the gospel, the ministry of Christ with that of Moses. For
  if the comparison had reference to the substance of promises, then there
  would be great disagreement between the Testaments. But since the trend of
  the argument leads us in another direction, we must follow it to find the
  truth. Let us then set forth the covenant that he once established as
  eternal and never perishing. Its fulfillment, by which it is finally
  confirmed and ratified, is Christ. (II. 11. 4)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">This difference is best seen in the presence of
ceremonies that were temporary and hence accidental to the covenant, which were
thus able to be discarded at Christ&rsquo;s coming without harming the covenant
itself,</p>

  <blockquote>While such confirmation was awaited, the Lord appointed, through
  Moses, ceremonies that were, so to speak, solemn symbols of that
  confirmation. A controversy arose over whether or not the ceremonies that
  had been ordained in the law ought to give way to Christ. Now these were
  only the accidental properties of the covenant, or additions and appendages,
  and in common parlance, accessories of it. Yet because they were means of
  administering it, they bear the name &ldquo;covenant,&rdquo; just as is
  customary in the case of other sacraments. To sum up, then, in this passage
  &ldquo;Old Testament&rdquo; means the solemn manner of confirming the
  covenant, comprised in ceremonies and sacrifices. (II. 11. 4)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Thus in Calvin&rsquo;s mind, the Old Testament and the
New Testament were not absolutely different, but the Old Testament actually
<em>became</em> the New Testament when Christ came and ratified the New
Testament that had always been symbolized in the shadowy ceremonies of the Old
Testament. Calvin explains,</p>

  <blockquote>Or, if you prefer, understand it thus: the Old Testament of
  the Lord was that covenant wrapped up in the shadowy and ineffectual
  <span class="page">[p. 198]</span>
  observance of ceremonies and delivered to the Jews; it was temporary because
  it remained, as it were, in suspense until it might rest upon a firm and
  substantial confirmation. It became new and eternal only after it was
  consecrated and established by the blood of Christ. Hence Christ in the
  supper calls the cup that he gives to his disciples, &ldquo;the cup of the
  New Testament in my blood.&rdquo; By this he means that the Testament of God
  attained its truth when sealed by his blood, and thereby becomes new and
  eternal. (II. 11. 4)</blockquote>

<p>The <em>third</em> difference between the Old and New Covenants, and the
second between the law and gospel, is the letter&ndash;spirit distinction. This
idea is in many respects an extension of the point Calvin has just explained
&mdash; that the Old Covenant became the New Covenant. In the prior point, the
change from the Old to the New was by the coming of Christ. In this
difference, the basis for the variation is due to the special work of the Holy
Spirit in the New Covenant. Here Calvin explains Jeremiah 31:31&ndash;34 and II
Corinthians 3:6&ndash;11. The passages are undeniably critical for
Calvin&rsquo;s perspective since they clearly contrast the Old and New
Covenants. The &ldquo;Old&rdquo; is termed that which was broken by Israel or a
covenant only of the letter, while the &ldquo;New&rdquo; is called a covenant
that is written by God upon the heart and hence a spiritual covenant. These
passages seem to argue that there is not one divine covenant throughout
Scripture, but rather that there are two of quite a different character.
Should that interpretation be correct, then Calvin would be forced to concede
the argument to the Anabaptists after all. How can he explain this difference
and still maintain the continuity of the Covenants?<a href="#_ftn16"
name="_ftnref16" title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<span class="page">[p. 199]</span>

<p>Calvin understands these texts to be calling the law &ldquo;literal&rdquo;
and the gospel &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; (II. 11. 7). This Calvin understands to
be because of the purpose of Jeremiah and Paul to analyze law in terms of what
properly belongs to it in contrast to what is associated with it by its
borrowing elements from the gospel. He explains,</p>

  <blockquote>For example: the law contains here and there promises of mercy,
  but because they have been borrowed from elsewhere, they are
  <span class="page">[p. 200]</span> not counted
  part of the law, when only the nature of the law is under discussion. They
  ascribe to it only this function: to enjoin what is right, to forbid what is
  wicked; to promise a reward to the keepers of righteousness, and threaten
  transgressors with punishment; but at the same time not to change or correct
  the depravity of heart that by nature inheres in all men.
  (II. 11. 7)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">In other words, the law can only be letter because in
itself it can only tell sinful men what to do and hence point out their sin,
but never enable them to overcome their evil. The gospel, on the other hand,
has the Holy Spirit that enables men actually to begin to be holy and do what
the law demands, since all of their sin is forgiven by Christ&rsquo;s
redemptive work.</p>

<p>This letter&ndash;spirit distinction is very carefully addressed in
Calvin&rsquo;s commentaries on the passages under discussion. Thus Calvin
explains how one ought to compare law and gospel in his comments on
Jeremiah 31:32ff. First, Calvin notes, one must recognize what the law is in
itself &mdash; a rule of righteousness that only speaks to the ear as letter
since it does not have the Spirit. But secondly, Calvin adds, this contrast
ceases once the Spirit is joined with the law. It is then no longer letter,
but actually spirit or the gospel itself. In fact, Calvin insists that it is
not a new law that the Spirit writes on the heart, but the very same law that
was once only letter.<a href="#_ftn17"
name="_ftnref17" title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a> Therefore Calvin insists that
the benefits of the New Covenant were even present in the law of the Old
Covenant. To illustrate this, Calvin mentions John 1:17. If grace and truth
have come through Christ and the law was of Moses, does this mean that
these benefits were absent from the law? His answer is that even though grace
and truth are only found in Christ, and the law does not have them as benefits
it can actually bestow, they were nonetheless present adventitiously. Simply,
there were borrowed from the gospel. In light of this, Moses can be considered
in two different senses. If he is 
<span class="page">[p. 201]</span> considered without Christ in his narrow
office (<em>cf.</em> <em>comm.</em> on Rom. 10:4ff) as lawgiver, his message
was only letter and hence produced only death. But if Moses is considered in
his whole teaching, he is seen to preach Christ as well. In that case, he must
be considered as a preacher of the gospel, the same gospel as is found in the
New Covenant.</p>

<p>Calvin&rsquo;s explanation of this critical point of the differences
between the Covenants in the midst of the one Covenant of Grace is even more
fully explained in two other texts in his commentaries. In Calvin&rsquo;s
comments on Psalm 19:8, a &ldquo;question of no small difficulty&rdquo; is
considered. David has been extolling the virtues of the law, but Paul later in
his epistles seems to overthrow entirely the commendations of the law which
David has cited &mdash; how can these two biblical authors be made to agree?
Calvin spells the contrast out in sharp clarity. The law restores the souls of
men, yet it is only a dead and deadly letter. It rejoices men&rsquo;s hearts,
yet by bringing in the spirit of bondage (Calvin&rsquo;s fourth difference
between the Old and New Covenants), it strikes men with terror. David says the
law enlightens the eyes, yet Paul says that it casts a veil before men&rsquo;s
minds, and so excludes the light which ought to penetrate it. What Calvin here
indicates is that the differences between the Covenants, presented by Paul and
Jeremiah, actually contradict David&rsquo;s understanding of the
&ldquo;Old&rdquo; Covenant if they are taken in an absolute sense as the
Anabaptists were wont to do.<a href="#_ftn18"
name="_ftnref18" title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a> Calvin&rsquo;s answer to the
<span class="page">[p. 202]</span> dilemma is similar to what he said in
Jeremiah 31. Just as the law of Moses
can be viewed with the Spirit and so be gospel, or without the Spirit and so
be the letter that kills, so also David must be seen as speaking not just of
the moral law, but of the &ldquo;whole covenant by which God had adopted the
descendants of Abraham.&rdquo; Thus David is seen by Calvin to be joining to
the law &mdash; the rule of living well &mdash; the free promises of
salvation, or Christ Himself. On the other hand, Paul must be interpreted in
light of the opponents he was dealing with. He was addressing persons who
abused and perverted the law by making it a basis of human meritorious
salvation. Thus it was Paul&rsquo;s point to show that the law without the
Spirit was unprofitable and deadly to men&rsquo;s souls. The law without
Christ could only be inexorable rigor which consequently curses all mankind
to wrath and the curse of God. Calvin&rsquo;s conclusion is that Paul must be
seen to be rehearsing what the law can do by itself without the promise of
grace. In this capacity, the law strictly and vigorously exacts men&rsquo;s
duty owed to God, which none fulfills. David&rsquo;s praise of the law,
however, is because he is considering the whole doctrine of the law, which
includes the gospel. Thus Calvin concludes, &ldquo;. . . under the law he
comprehends Christ.&rdquo; It is clear, therefore, that Calvin does not see
the law as antithetical to the gospel since it includes Christ. It is only so
when Christ is excluded from it as the Judaizers had done, and as was
consequently considered by Paul in his refutation of their doctrine of
salvation by human merit.</p>

<p>But Calvin does not simply explain the passages of Jeremiah and Paul on the
differences between the Old and New Covenants by viewing the Old Covenant in a
<em>narrow</em> sense without Christ and in a normative sense in which Christ
or the whole of the blessings of the covenant are included. He is too much
aware of the history of redemption and God&rsquo;s distinctive administration
of the covenant in <span class="page">[p. 203]</span> various ages to do this.
Thus in his evaluation of the
citation of Jeremiah 31:31ff. found in the eighth chapter of Hebrews, Calvin
indicates that there is also the important difference of the comparison of the
lesser to the greater. Thus Calvin asks if the Spirit&rsquo;s regeneration
and Christ&rsquo;s forgiveness of sins were benefits enjoyed by the Old
Testament saints. These he has already called &ldquo;the two main parts in
this covenant.&rdquo; He affirms that they indeed had these benefits of the
covenant even in the Old Testament administration of the covenant of grace,
but to a lesser extent than the New Testament saint. Calvin points to three
ways in which the New Covenant is greater than the Old Covenant. First, he
indicates that the power of the Spirit is greater. God the Father has more
fully put forth the power of the Spirit under the kingdom of Christ. Second,
He has poured forth more abundantly his mercy on mankind, such that in
comparison to this the grace of God on the fathers is insignificant. Third,
while the promises of God with respect to salvation were known in the Old
Covenant, they were obscure and intricate in comparison to the clarity of
revelation of the New Covenant. Calvin likens this to the light of the moon
and the stars in comparison to the clear light of the sun.</p>

<p>Yet Calvin is aware that this interpretation can be challenged by the case
of Abraham. In comparison to him, New Covenant believers are lesser, and he is
the greater. Calvin&rsquo;s response is that this comparison is not to be made
of specific persons, but with respect to the economical condition of the
church. Thus under the Old Covenant economy of the Covenant of Grace the
fathers&rsquo; spiritual gifts were accidental to their age. They had to
direct their eyes to Christ in order to possess them. So Calvin says that the
apostle&rsquo;s comparing of the law to the gospel as two different covenants
was taking away from the law what was peculiar to the gospel. Nevertheless,
Calvin asserts, &ldquo;There is yet no reason why God should not have extended
the grace of the New Covenant to the fathers.&rdquo; This Calvin says is the
&ldquo;true solution of the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In attempting to summarize Calvin&rsquo;s viewpoint on the relationship of
the Old and New Covenants in light of the letter&ndash;spirit distinction, it
is helpful to keep in mind that he uses the term &ldquo;New Covenant&rdquo; in
two distinct senses. In the strict sense of Biblical redemptive history,
Calvin understands the New Covenant as the gospel era brought to pass by
Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work and His subsequent sending of the Holy Spirit
in His full apostolic manifestation and power. But Calvin also understands the
New Covenant in a broader sense, that is, the New Covenant has always
<span class="page">[p. 204]</span> been the
saving relationship between God and His elect throughout the ages. It either
looked forward in promise to Christ&rsquo;s coming or it harks back to His
accomplishment of redemption. While this viewpoint is distinctively a mark of
Calvinism, it is not unimportant to realize that Calvin was fully conscious of
his indebtedness to Augustine at this point.  Referring to Augustine, he
writes,</p>

  <blockquote>In the same passage he very aptly adds the following: the
  children of the promise, reborn of God, who have obeyed the commands by
  faith working through love have belonged to the New Covenant since the world
  began. This they did, not in hope of carnal, earthly, and temporal things,
  but in hope of spiritual, heavenly, and eternal benefits. For they believed
  especially in the Mediator; and they did not doubt that through him the
  Spirit was given to them that they might do good, and that they were
  pardoned whenever they sinned. It is that very point which I intended to
  affirm: all the saints whom Scripture mentions as being peculiarly chosen of
  God from the beginning of the world have shared with us the same blessing
  unto eternal salvation. (II. 11. 10)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Calvin in full agreement with Augustine understands that
the New Covenant has always been the place of salvation. So Calvin must be read
with care with respect to which of the two meanings of the New Covenant he is
employing.</p>

<p>It is also true that Calvin has a twofold use of the term
&ldquo;law.&rdquo; It can be used either in the strict sense of the Pauline
usage to combat self-congratulatory works of human merit, or in the broad
sense of the rule of living well which is coupled with the Spirit&rsquo;s
enablement and Christ&rsquo;s forgiveness. In the first sense, there is a very
profound difference between law and gospel. In the second, however, there is
no longer any difference between the law and gospel since the Spirit has been
added to the law and Christ&rsquo;s forgiveness as well. Calvin states this
with succinctness in his comments on Dt. 30:11 where he argues that law and
gospel are one by the New Covenant.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"
title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a> Under the heading of &ldquo;The Use of the
Law&rdquo; in the same commentary, <span class="page">[p. 205]</span>
Calvin lists four distinct uses of the law
which highlight this twofold use of the term &ldquo;law.&rdquo; The first two
are for instruction and condemnation. The second two correspond to the first
two respectively as explanations of them. Thus the third is that the law is
used by the Spirit in His regenerating work in the believer (<em>cf.</em>
instruction). The fourth is an explanation of why Paul &ldquo;seems&rdquo; to
abrogate the law (<em>cf.</em> condemnation).<a href="#_ftn20"
name="_ftnref20" title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a> The fourth point is once again
Calvin&rsquo;s <span class="page">[p. 206]</span>
understanding of Paul&rsquo;s special task of refuting the
attempt to gain salvation by meritorious observance of the law. Calvin himself
offers a helpful summary of these matters in his comments on Galatians 3:25
and 4:1. In the first text he asks, &ldquo;How is the law abolished?&rdquo;
His answer is that it is not abolished as a rule of life and cites
II Timothy 3:16&ndash;17. It is abolished, however in all that differs in
comparison of Moses with the covenant of grace. These differences he lists as
an unabating demand for exact obedience without forgiveness, a severe reckoning
of the smallest offenses, Christ is not openly exhibited, but rather He and
His grace are seen only distantly in ceremonies. In the second text he
concludes, &ldquo;All this leads to the conclusion, that the difference
between us and the ancient fathers lies in accidents, not in substance. In all
the leading characters of the testament or covenant we agree. . . .&rdquo; In
light of these considerations, two texts already cited take on a greater depth
of meaning. Calvin&rsquo;s statement that God&rsquo;s people &ldquo;since the
beginning of the world were covenanted to him by the same law and by the bond
of the same doctrine&rdquo; (II. 10. 2) can be seen to be understood by him as
the normal use of the law as a rule of life. Similarly, Calvin&rsquo;s view
that &ldquo;Moses was not made a lawgiver to wipe out the blessing promised to
the race of Abraham. Rather, we see him repeatedly reminding the Jews of the
freely given covenant made with their fathers. . .&rdquo; is also clearly a
further affirmation that the Pauline interpretation of law is not the normal
use of law, but rather a special application of it. In interpreting
Calvin&rsquo;s theological perspective on the relationship of the Old and New
Covenants, then, one must be cognizant of his twofold use of the terms
&ldquo;New Covenant&rdquo; and &ldquo;law.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Can Men Break the New Covenant?</h2>

<p>Yet one last matter of importance for Calvin&rsquo;s understanding of
<span class="page">[p. 207]</span> the
relationship of the Old and New Covenants must be examined in relation to the
letter&ndash;spirit distinction. If these two are really one and the same
covenant that are different only in externals, then does the mass defection of
Israel also imply that there can be a mass defection of the New Covenant era
saints? But if this is admitted is not one forced to say that the covenant is
defective since God would therefore seem not to write His law effectually on
the hearts of His people? But if this is denied, then does not the
letter&ndash;spirit distinction actually prove that they are two different
covenants having a different substance? The Old Covenant of the letter could
obviously have many who could fall away from it since the law was not Spirit
written. On the other hand, the New Covenant cannot allow any to fall away
since they are infallibly secured by the effectual application of the law to
their heart.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a> In
a word, does the New Covenant allow for such covenant-breaking as the Old
Covenant experienced in light of the former&rsquo;s being only of the letter
and the latter&rsquo;s being of the Spirit?<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"
title=""><sup>[22]</sup></a> How can Calvin&rsquo;s claim that the only
difference between the two is with respect to the extent and power of the
Spirit&rsquo;s work explain this dilemma? Does this accord with the
Bible&rsquo;s view of the church?</p>

<p>Calvin is keenly aware of this argument that would substantiate the
Anabaptist claim of a substantial rather than an accidental difference between
the Old and New Covenants. For instance, he admits that the Old Covenant is
seen as inferior to the New, &ldquo;Indeed, Jeremiah calls even the moral law
a weak and fragile covenant.&rdquo; Yet Calvin is unwilling to see this defect
in the covenant, but rather in the people.</p>

  <blockquote>But that is for another reason: by the sudden defection of an
  ungrateful people it was soon broken off. However, because the people were
  to blame for such a violation, it cannot properly be charged against the
  covenant. (II. 11. 8)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Calvin&rsquo;s answer thus far is that the covenant was
not weak in itself but was weak by the ingratitude of the covenanted people.
His next point is that the difference between the two is once again to be
interpreted not as an absolute contrast but as a comparison.</p>

  <blockquote>We are not to surmise from this difference between letter and
  spirit that the Lord had fruitlessly bestowed his law upon the Jews,
  <span class="page">[p. 208]</span> and
  that none of them turned to him. But it was put forward by way of comparison
  to commend the grace abounding, where with the same Lawgiver &mdash;
  assuming, as it were, a new character &mdash; honored the preaching of the
  gospel. (II. 11. 8)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Even though the covenant was weak due to the
people&rsquo;s ingratitude, Calvin says, this must not be made to teach that
there were none who experienced its benefits in the Old Testament era. Rather,
in comparison to the New Covenant, there were almost none although in its own
right there were many.  Calvin states,</p>

  <blockquote>For suppose we reckon the multitude of those whom he gathers
  into the communion of his church from all peoples, men regenerated by his
  Spirit through the preaching of the gospel. Then we will say that in ancient
  Israel there were very few &mdash; almost none &mdash; who embraced the
  Lord&rsquo;s covenant with their whole hearts and minds. Yet, reckoned by
  themselves without comparison, there were many. (II. 11. 8)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Since Calvin has argued for the continuity of the
covenant on the basis of comparison, must he not therefore admit the reality of
covenant-breaking in the New Covenant? Further, how can this concept be
consistent with the very benefit of the covenant that promises that God writes
the law upon the believer&rsquo;s heart?</p>

<p>Calvin&rsquo;s answer to this question is not found in the immediate
context of the letter&ndash;spirit distinction (II. 11. 8). While Calvin makes
passing reference to this question at numerous points in the
<em>Institutes</em>,<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"
title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a> his most thorough explanation comes from his
comments on Romans 11:22. There is no question in Calvin&rsquo;s mind that
people in the New Covenant era can by their ingratitude not persevere in
God&rsquo;s goodness.</p>

  <blockquote>They indeed who have been illuminated by the Lord ought always
  to think of perseverance; for they continue not in the goodness of God, who
  having for a time responded to the call of God, do at length begin to loathe
  the kingdom of heaven, and thus by their ingratitude justly deserve to be
  blinded again.</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">In saying this, Calvin is fully admitting that there is
in reality the experience of covenant-breaking in the New Covenant era even as
<span class="page">[p. 209]</span> there was in the Old Covenant
administration,</p>

  <blockquote>For he would have the gentiles to depend on the eternal
  covenant of God, so as to connect their own with the salvation of the elect
  people, and then, lest the rejection of the Jews should produce offence, as
  though their ancient adoption were void, he would have them to be terrified
  by this example of punishment, so as reverently to regard the judgment of
  God.</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">At this point, Calvin goes on to make an important
distinction between God&rsquo;s corporate and individual election. Paul,
according to Calvin, is speaking primarily of corporate election and covenant
breaking,</p>

  <blockquote>But as he speaks not of the elect individually, but of the whole
  body, a condition is added, if they continued in his kindness. I indeed
  allow, that as soon as any one abuses God&rsquo;s goodness, he deserves to
  be deprived of the offered favour; but it would be improper to say of any
  one of the godly particularly, that God had mercy on him when he chose him,
  provided he would continue in his mercy; for the perseverance of faith,
  which completes in us the effect of God&rsquo;s grace, flows from election
  itself. Paul then teaches us, that the Gentiles were admitted into the hope
  of eternal life on the condition, that they by their gratitude retained
  possession of it.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"
  title=""><sup>[24]</sup></a></blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Thus Calvin sees this breaking away from the covenant as
a real possibility for the gentiles of the New Covenant as the corporate people
of the covenant, although Calvin states that this has implications for
individuals as well. But not only does Calvin state that covenant-breaking is a
distinct possibility for the gentiles in the New Covenant, he insists that this
has already happened,</p>

  <blockquote>And dreadful indeed was the defection of the whole world, which
  afterwards happened; and this clearly proves, that this exhortation was not
  superfluous; for when God had almost in a moment watered it with his grace,
  so that religion flourished everywhere, soon after the truth of the gospel
  vanished, and the treasure of salvation was taken away. And whence came so
  sudden a change except that the Gentiles had fallen away from their
  calling?</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Calvin applies this point specifically to the Roman
Church with a profound sense of the God-abandonedness that he sees
characteristic <span class="page">[p. 210]</span>
of the Papal Church in the Reformation. Calvin declares, in his
commentary on Hosea 2:4, 5,</p>

  <blockquote>. . . that it is not enough that God should choose any people
  for himself, except the people themselves persevere in the obedience of
  faith; for this is the spiritual chastity which the Lord requires from all
  his people. But when is a wife, whom God bath bound to himself by a sacred
  marriage, said to become wanton? When she falls away, as we shall more
  clearly see hereafter, from pure and sound faith. Then it follows that the
  marriage between God and men so long endures as they who have been adopted
  continue in pure faith, and apostacy in a manner frees God from us, so that
  he may justly repudiate us. Since such apostacy prevails under the Papacy,
  and has for many ages prevailed, how senseless they are in their boasting,
  while they would be thought to be the holy Catholic Church, and the elect
  people of God? For they are all born by wantonness, they are all spurious
  children. The incorruptible seed is the word of God; but what sort of
  doctrine have they? It is a spurious seed. Then as to God all the Papists
  are bastards. In vain then they boast themselves to be the children of God,
  and that they have the holy Mother Church, for they are born by filthy
  wantonness.</blockquote> 

<p class="non-indent">Calvin makes use of this fact of the covenant-breaking of
the Roman Church several times in his writings. But Calvin has already said
that this has some bearing on individuals even though it has primary
application to the corporately elect people of the gentile church. How does
this idea of covenant-breaking apply to individuals in the New Covenant?</p>

<p>Continuing in his exposition of Romans 11:22, Calvin addresses the question
of how this warning of covenant-breaking applies to the elect,</p>

  <blockquote>We now understand in what sense Paul threatens them with
  excision, whom he has already allowed to have been grafted into the hope of
  life through God&rsquo;s election. For, first, though this cannot happen to
  the elect, they have yet need of such warning, in order to subdue the pride
  of the flesh; which being really opposed to their salvation, ought justly to
  be terrified with the dread of perdition. As far then as Christians are
  illuminated by faith, they hear, for their assurance, that the calling of
  God is without repentance; but as far as they carry about them the flesh,
  which wantonly resists the grace of God, they are taught humility by this
  warning, &ldquo;Take heed lest thou be cut off.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">In essence, Calvin here affirms that the warnings of
Scripture are not merely hypothetical, but are true warnings. Even though one
is elect, he still is in battle with the pride of the flesh which is
<span class="page">[p. 211]</span> opposed to
his salvation. To be taught humility before God, the warnings are a necessary
means of grace. Calvin does not stop with his adherence to the necessity of
warnings for the elect in his explanation of how covenant-breaking applies to
New Covenant people. To this idea, he adds a highly developed scheme of how an
individual is grafted into and excised from the covenant. Calvin explains,</p>

  <blockquote>But if it be asked respecting individuals, &ldquo;How any one
  could be cut off from the grafting, and how after excision, he could be
  grafted again,&rdquo; &mdash; bear in mind, that there are three modes of
  insition, and two modes of excision. For instance, the children of the
  faithful are ingrafted, to whom the promise belongs according to the
  covenant made with the fathers; ingrafted are also they who indeed receive
  the seed of the gospel, but it strikes no root, or it is choked before it
  brings any fruit; and thirdly the elect are ingrafted, who are illuminated
  unto eternal life according to the immutable purpose of God.</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Calvin begins his approach to this question with three
possible modes of entrance into the covenant: by birth into a Christian home,
by hypocritical faith, and by true conversion growing out of divine election.
To these three modes of insition, Calvin adds two modes of excision,</p>

  <blockquote>The first are cut off, when they refuse the promise given to
  their fathers, or do not receive it on account of their ingratitude; the
  second are cut off, when the seed is withered and destroyed; and as the
  danger of this impends over all, with regard to their own nature, it must be
  allowed that this warning which Paul gives belongs in a certain way to the
  faithful, lest they indulge themselves in the sloth of the flesh. But with
  regard to the present passage, it is enough for us to know, that the
  vengeance which God had executed on the Jews, is pronounced on the Gentiles,
  in case they become like them.</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Covenant children according to Calvin can be cut off from
the covenant by refusing the promise or by ingratitude. Hypocrites are cut off
from the covenant when the seed of the Word of God is destroyed in their lives.
With respect to the elect, Calvin once again affirms his conviction that this
warning is also applicable to the elect since they in this life are burdened
with the lust of the flesh and could from the vantage point of human
responsibility apostatize. For Calvin, it is highly significant to realize
that the warnings of apostasy are not to be ignored, since there are always
members of the church &mdash; the corporately elect people of the covenant
&mdash; who will fall away from the promise of their baptism or their
profession of faith. While the truly <span class="page">[p. 212]</span>
elect of God can never fail to persevere,
they must ever be on guard against the flesh and are in fact aided in their
struggle by the warnings.</p>

<p>Here, then, one sees that Calvin&rsquo;s understanding of the
letter&ndash;spirit distinction has a bearing of his view of the church. The
church is not composed entirely of those who have the Spirit-written law upon
their hearts, but also of those who have the promise that such will be done
(baptized children) and those who claim that it has been done, but in reality
are hypocrites. The Anabaptist view of the gathered church grows out of an
absolute view of the differences between the Old and New Covenants.
Calvin&rsquo;s perspective on the church recognizes that there is a broader
sphere of election than those who are the true recipients of the Spirit. This
is in keeping with the church of Israel where there was a mixed multitude. The
difference for Calvin, then, is found in the fact that there are many more
truly elect in the New Covenant church than in the Old Covenant church, but
since the covenant is broader than its actual application, there can be still
covenant-breaking in the New Covenant.</p>

<p>In this way Calvin is able to explain how the reality of covenant-breaking
relates to the infallibly applied New Covenant. It is of interest to observe
how Calvin applies this approach to the covenant to his own experience. Calvin
had been baptized into the covenant by a Roman priest. Yet, he failed to keep
the promise of baptism and become a covenant-breaker. Nevertheless, God in His
mercy restored him back into the covenant relationship. Each of these points
may be observed in his comments on Hosea 2:19, 20,</p>

  <blockquote>What fellowship have we with God, when we are born and come out
  of the womb, except he graciously adopts us? For we bring nothing, we know,
  with us but a curse: this is the heritage of all mankind. Since it is so,
  all our salvation must necessarily have its foundation in the goodness and
  mercies of God. But there is also another reason in our case, when God
  receives us into favour; for we were covenant-breakers under the Papacy;
  there was not one of us who had not departed from the pledge of his baptism;
  and so we could not have returned into favour with God, except he had freely
  united us to himself and God not only forgave us, but contracted also a new
  marriage with us, so that we can now, as on the day of our youth, as it has
  been previously said, openly give thanks to him.</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Did Calvin take the warning of falling away from the
covenant seriously? Did he believe that he might stumble away from the covenant
even though he was one of God&rsquo;s elect? Calvin answers this question
<span class="page">[p. 213]</span> very
pointedly although indirectly in his prayer at the conclusion of Lecture Fourth
in his Commentary on Hosea. There he depicts the idea of the broken covenant he
had experienced in the Roman Church that had been restored in his life by the
Reformation with the earnest prayer that he might not fall away again, this
time as a hypocrite,</p>

  <blockquote>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast not only of late adopted
  us as thy children but before we were born, and as thou hast been pleased to
  sign us, as soon as we came forth from our mother&rsquo;s womb, with the
  symbol of that holy redemption, which has been obtained for us by the blood
  of thy only begotten Son, though we have by our ingratitude renounced so
  great a benefit &mdash; O grant, that being mindful of our defection and
  unfaithfulness, of which we are all guilty, and for which thou hast justly
  rejected us, we may now with true humility and obedience of faith embrace
  the grace of thy gospel now again offered to us, by which thou reconciles
  thyself to us; and grant that we may steadfastly persevere in pure faith, so
  as never to turn aside from the true obedience of faith, but to advance more
  and more in the knowledge of thy mercy, that having strong and deep roots,
  and being firmly grounded in the confidence of sure faith, we may never fall
  away from the true worship of thee, until thou at length receivest us into
  that eternal kingdom, which has been procured for us by the blood of thy
  only Son. Amen.</blockquote>

<p>While the matter is quite complex, it must be admitted that Calvin has
thoroughly thought through his viewpoint of the letter&ndash;spirit
distinction. He insists that the distinction of law&ndash;gospel is a specific
application of the law &mdash; severed from Christ &mdash; and not its
normative use. The law is fully in accord with the New Covenant in its
continual progress in all the ages of redemption, even until the New Covenant
actually &ldquo;became&rdquo; new with its ratification in Christ&rsquo;s
redemptive work. Thus Calvin asserts that the relationship of the Old and New
Covenants is one of lesser to greater in comparison rather than an absolute
dichotomy. In keeping with this viewpoint, Calvin further maintains that there
is covenant-breaking even in the New Covenantal era of the &ldquo;New&rdquo;
Covenant or Covenant of Grace. This is different from Israel only in the extent
of those who fall away; nevertheless, the apostasy of Rome indicates that a
near total apostasy of the gentiles was equally possible as that of Israel.
Therefore, Calvin understands that the Covenant is broader than the actual
application of the Spirit-written law to the heart in the New Covenant even as
it was in the Old Covenant. Thus, for Calvin, the church is not made up
exclusively of <span class="page">[p. 214]</span>
&ldquo;regenerate&rdquo; members of a gathered church, but of
those who have some claim to the promise of the covenant. In fact, Calvin
includes himself among those who have been severed from the covenant by
ingratitude, and who have been restored by divine grace. Further, Calvin also
is struck by the warnings of apostasy and prays that he be kept from falling
away again as a hypocrite.</p>

<p>If modern Baptists object to this approach by claiming that the baptistic
approach is much simpler and more likely to maintain the purity of the church
by its insistence on regenerate church membership, it is important to realize
that the problems that Calvin has here struggled with are applicable to them
as well. Is it not true that many &ldquo;regenerate&rdquo; people have walked
an aisle or sought baptism and have received the ordinance of baptism as adult
believers only to fall away from their profession? It is this fact of
experience itself that indicates the impossibility of inerrantly practicing
the regenerate church concept. If anyone has ever been baptized and then later
shown himself to be a genuine hypocrite who has finally apostatized from the
truth, the reality of a regenerate church membership is disproved. While
Calvin&rsquo;s approach may not appear ideal to the baptistic viewpoint, it
nevertheless is the only approach that can handle the state of the church as
it really exists in this world.</p>

<p>Perhaps no better illustration from Calvin&rsquo;s writings of this
interplay between law, letter&ndash;spirit, and the genuine and hypocritical
peoples of the covenant or church can be found than his comment on Genesis
21:12. There Calvin speaks of the &ldquo;perpetual condition of the
church.&rdquo; Calvin says that the church or the spiritual kingdom of Christ
is born of the law. From the law, two types of children are born &mdash; those
born of the letter and those born of the Spirit. The first are illustrated by
Hagar who is the letter giving birth to Ishmael who is an adulterous son. Over
against these two are Sarah who illustrates the Spirit, and Isaac who is the
true son. Calvin proceeds to say that the church has children of the letter or
adulterous sons who are born into slavery to the law and are so hypocrites. In
his day, these children of the letter, or adulterous sons in slavery to the
law and hypocrisy are the members of the papal church. One can now understand
why he called them &ldquo;bastards&rdquo; in his comment on Hosea 2:4, 5 cited
above. On the other hand, Calvin sees the true sons of the Spirit as those who
are born into liberty as the sons of God. These, of course, are the
Protestants, although Calvin does not say so in this passage.<a href="#_ftn25"
name="_ftnref25" title=""><sup>[25]</sup></a> The first group, Calvin says,
are &ldquo;apparently <span class="page">[p. 215]</span>
born of the Word of God, and therefore in a sense, the
sons of God.&rdquo; The latter group, however, are &ldquo;born of the
incorruptible seed of the Word&rdquo; and hence are true sons. For Calvin,
then, &ldquo;law&rdquo; can result in slavery and hypocrisy or it can result
in liberty and true sonship. What makes the difference? The answer is found in
a proper understanding of the letter&ndash;spirit distinction. To absolutize
the distinction results in an Anabaptist conception of the church. Yet this
view leaves the Old Covenant saints as without the Spirit&rsquo;s blessing. Nor
can it explain why there are covenant-breakers in the New Covenant era, if the
difference is taken as absolute. On the other hand, Calvin&rsquo;s
interpretation of a comparison from lesser to greater explains the Old
Covenant saints&rsquo; experience of salvation, how David can delight in the
law and Paul can be terrified by it, and how there can be covenant-breaking
even in the New Covenant. The result is a Reformed conception of the church
that recognizes the impossibility of having a totally &ldquo;regenerate&rdquo;
church membership. Calvin&rsquo;s view recognizes that the unity of the
covenants in all the ages demands that the church also be arranged along the
lines of the covenant. While all of this may seem complex, it can be
simplified if it is studied in graphic form. This chart attempts to
incorporate the main points considered so far.</p>

<h2>Calvin&rsquo;s View of the Relationship of the Church<br>
and the Covenant Throughout History</h2>

<img src="covenants.png" width="649" height="328">

<p>It would perhaps be helpful to provide a few more specific examples from
Calvin&rsquo;s writings to illustrate how he viewed this matter
<span class="page">[p. 216]</span> of members of
the New Covenant in the sense of &ldquo;general election&rdquo; being
designated as covenant-breakers. Calvin sees the reality of covenant-breaking
associated with baptism in the case of the papal church.</p>

  <blockquote>The same thing that the Prophet brought against the Israelites
  may be also brought against the Papists; for as soon as infants are born
  among them, the Lord signs them with the sacred symbol of baptism; they are
  therefore in some sense the people of God. We see, at the same time, how
  gross and abominable are the superstitions which prevail among them: there
  are none more stupid than they are. Even the Turks and the Saracenes are
  wise when compared with them. How great, then, and how shameful is this
  baseness, that the Papists, who boast themselves to be the people of God,
  should go astray after their own mad follies!<a href="#_ftn26"
  name="_ftnref26" title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a></blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Even though they have the sign of the covenant, they fail
to keep God&rsquo;s Word by their superstitious practices. Not only does Calvin
see this form of covenant-breaking, but he also is keenly aware of the reality
of hypocrisy, both in the papal church and in the church of the Reformation as
well.</p>

  <blockquote>Since then the sacrifices were daily performed and since the
  kingdom still retained its outward form, they thought that God was, in a
  manner, bound to them. The same is the case at this day with the great part
  of men; they presumptuously and absurdly boast of the external forms of
  religion. The Papists possess the name of a Church, with which they are
  extremely inflated; and then there is a great show and pomp in their
  ceremonies. The hypocrites also among us boast of Baptism, and the
  Lord&rsquo;s Supper, and the name of Reformation; while, at the same time,
  these are nothing but mockeries, by which the name of God and the whole
  operation of religion are profaned, when no real piety flourishes in the
  heart.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"
  title=""><sup>[27]</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>Because of the ever present danger of disobedience, one who is in the
&ldquo;special election&rdquo; sphere must be ever mindful of his
responsibility to keep the covenant. Even one who believes that he is truly
elect may stumble and prove himself to be a hypocrite. Perhaps no passage in
Calvin&rsquo;s writings more graphically presents the necessity of taking the
warnings of Scripture seriously and thus repenting from sin than his comments
on Leviticus 26:40:</p>

  <blockquote>Whence too, it follows, that all punishments are like spurs to
  arouse the inert and hesitating to repentance, whilst the sorer
  <span class="page">[p. 217]</span> plagues are
  intended to break their hard hearts. Yet at the same time, it must be
  observed that this favor is vouchsafed by special privilege, to the church
  of God. Moses soon afterwards expressly assigns its cause, that is, that God
  will remember his covenant. Whence it is plain that God out of regard to his
  gratuitous adoption, will be gracious to the unworthy whom He has
  <em>elected</em>; and whence also it comes to pass, that provided we do not
  close the gate of hope against ourselves, God will still voluntarily come
  forward to reconcile us to Himself, if only we lay hold of the
  <em>covenant</em> from which we have <em>fallen</em> by our own guilt, like
  shipwrecked sailors seizing a plank to carry them safe into port.
  (Italics mine.)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Here Calvin pointedly indicates the reality of falling
from the covenant by disobedience. Only if one does not &ldquo;close the gate
of hope against&rdquo; himself, and seizes the covenant from which he has
fallen, will God &ldquo;come forward to reconcile&rdquo; Himself. Here Calvin
is emphasizing the element of human responsibility in the covenant
relationship. The covenant-breaker is responsible to seize the
&ldquo;plank&rdquo; if he desires to be carried &ldquo;safe into port.&rdquo;
It is of utmost importance to note that Calvin once again uses the personal
pronouns &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;ourselves&rdquo;, and &ldquo;us&rdquo; in his
application. He undoubtedly saw this as a reality for himself, that could be
prevented by taking the abundant warnings of Scripture seriously. Calvin here
unhesitatingly unites the danger of falling away from the covenant with the
doctrine of election (note italicized words). Once again it is seen that
Calvin&rsquo;s view of baptism is not an independent doctrine with little
significance for his other doctrinal formulations. Instead, as here, it
results in a very important perspective in his overall doctrinal perspective:
Calvin sees that his doctrine of infant baptism explains why there is at least
in part covenant-breaking in the new covenant. Because the letter&ndash;spirit
distinction is one of comparison and not absolute contrast, the baptized
members of the New Covenant can fall away by ingratitude from their place in
the covenant even as Old Covenant people rejected in unthankfulness the
promise of their circumcision. In fact, Calvin avers, this is the experience
of the Roman Church and his own spiritual life.</p>

<p class="section-break">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The remaining differences between the Old and New Covenants in
Calvin&rsquo;s understanding have already been touched upon above in an
indirect manner. The <em>fourth</em> difference and the third between law and
gospel is the bondage of the Old Covenant and the freedom of
<span class="page">[p. 218]</span> the New Covenant.
Calvin explains,</p>

  <blockquote>The fourth difference arises out of the third. Scripture calls
  the Old Testament one of &ldquo;bondage&rdquo; because it produces fear in
  men&rsquo;s minds; but the New Testament, one of &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;
  because it lifts them to trust and assurance. (II. 11. 9)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">This understanding of the Old Testament seems, however,
to take away the blessings of the Spirit that Calvin has already argued
properly belonged to the holy patriarchs. Did they not have the same freedom
and joy? Calvin&rsquo;s explanation once again indicates his understanding of
the New Covenant as the place of salvation in all of redemptive history. It
further points to his recognition of the comparison of lesser to greater in
that the Old Testament saints did not have this freedom and joy to the same
extent as the New Testament saints. He states,</p>

  <blockquote>But when through the law the patriarchs felt themselves both
  oppressed by their enslaved condition, and wearied by anxiety of conscience,
  they fled for refuge to the gospel. It was therefore a particular fruit of
  the New Testament that, apart from the common law of the Old Testament, they
  were exempted from those evils. Further, we shall deny that they were so
  endowed with the spirit of freedom and assurance as not in some degree to
  experience the fear and bondage arising from the law. For, however much they
  enjoyed the privilege that they had received through the grace of the
  gospel, they were still subject to the same bonds and burdens of ceremonial
  observances as the common people. They were compelled to observe those
  ceremonies punctiliously, symbols of tutelage resembling bondage. . . Hence,
  they are rightly said, in contrast to us, to have been under the testament
  of bondage and fear. . . . (II. 11. 9)</blockquote>

<p>The <em>fifth</em> and final difference between the Covenants for Calvin is
that the Old Covenant was limited to the nation of Israel while the New
Covenant is extended by God to all nations. Calvin explains,</p>

  <blockquote>The fifth difference, which may be added, lies in the fact that
  until the advent of Christ, the Lord set apart one nation within which to
  confine the covenant of his grace. . . He lodged his covenant, so to speak,
  in their bosom; he manifested the presence of his majesty over them; he
  showered every privilege upon them. But &mdash; to pass over the remaining
  blessings &mdash; let us consider the one in question. In communicating his
  Word to them, he joined them to himself, that he might be called and
  esteemed their God. In the meantime, &ldquo;he allowed all other nations to
  walk&rdquo; in vanity, as if they had nothing whatsoever to do with him.
  (II. 11. 11)</blockquote>

<span class="page">[p. 219]</span>

<p>Because God changed His administration of the gospel by
opening it up to all nations, Calvin sees this as a superiority of the New
Covenant over the Old Covenant. He states,</p>

  <blockquote>The calling of the Gentiles, therefore, is a notable mark of the
  excellence of the New Testament over the Old. Indeed, this had been attested
  before by many very clear utterances of the prophets, but in such a way that
  its fulfillment was postponed until the Kingdom of Messiah.
  (II. 11. 12)</blockquote>

<h2>III. Calvin&rsquo;s Use of the Covenant to Defend Infant Baptism.</h2>

<p>Thus far, we have seen Calvin&rsquo;s understanding of the
continuity of the Old and New Covenants as well as his perspective on how they
differ from one another. In both instances, Calvin develops his conception of
the covenant against the viewpoint of the Anabaptist theology. In the first
case, Calvin insists that the New Covenant has always been the place of
redemption whether in the Old economy or the New. Thus he rejects the
Anabaptist idea of the radical disjuncture of the Old Testament and the New
Testament. He refuses the idea of a materialistic covenant versus a spiritual
covenant. Secondly, Calvin also recognizes Biblical differences between the
two covenants, but not in a substantial sense as the Anabaptists aver. The
differences are due to variations in externals. Thus there is in
Calvin&rsquo;s mind a real ministry of the &ldquo;Spirit&rdquo; in the Old
Covenant of the &ldquo;letter.&rdquo; With this &ldquo;hermeneutical&rdquo;
background, we can now approach the question of Calvin&rsquo;s defense of
infant baptism <em>vis a vis</em> the Anabaptist view of believer&rsquo;s
baptism.</p>

<p>It must be strongly emphasized that Calvin&rsquo;s exposition of infant
baptism is saturated with the concept of the covenant. In fact, the sacrament
of baptism is the common vow of the church whereby both God and man are joined
in a contractual relationship. Baptism is for Calvin the contract of the
covenant of grace. In this relationship, God gives mercy and eternal life
while man accepts the stipulation of perfect obedience in the context of
forgiveness of sins and the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification.<a href="#_ftn28"
name="_ftnref28" title=""><sup>[28]</sup></a> In light of this and all that
has been presented above, it is little wonder that Calvin unleashes his
assault on Anabaptist theology by a barrage of covenantal
argumentation.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"
title=""><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<span class="page">[p. 220]</span>

<p>Calvin both presents his case for paedobaptism as well as defends it
against various attacks by employment of the covenant idea. His positive
arguments build initially upon his already established point of the continuity
of the Old and New Covenants. It is due to the continuity of the covenant with
the Jews and with Christians that enables Christians to baptize their
infants:</p>

  <blockquote>For he expressly declares that the circumcision of a tiny infant
  will be in lieu of a seal to certify the promise of the covenant. But if the
  covenant still remains firm and steadfast, it applies no less today to the
  children of Christians than under the Old Testament it pertained to the
  infants of the Jews. Yet if they are participants in the thing signified,
  why shall they be debarred from the sign? (IV. 16. 5)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">On the other hand, the discontinuity of the covenants in
externals allows Calvin to refute an objection against his view:</p>

  <blockquote>The objection that there was a stated day for circumcision is
  sheer evasion. We admit that we are not now bound to certain days like the
  Jews; but since the Lord, without fixing the day yet declares that he is
  pleased to receive infants into his covenant with a solemn rite, what more
  do we require? (IV. 16. 5)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Calvin is so adamant that the covenant with the Jews
continues into the New Covenant era that he asserts that to deny this is
nothing less than blasphemy. This is because such a view implies that
Christ&rsquo;s coming actually narrowed God&rsquo;s grace rather than expanding
it:<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<span class="page">[p. 221]</span>

  <blockquote>Yet Scripture opens to us a still surer knowledge of the truth.
  Indeed, it is most evident that the covenant which the Lord once made with
  Abraham is no less in force today for Christians than it was of old for the
  Jewish people, and that this work relates no less to Christians than it then
  related to the Jews. Unless perhaps we think that Christ by his coming
  lessened or curtailed the grace of the Father &mdash; but this is nothing
  but execrable blasphemy! Accordingly, the children of the Jews also, because
  they had been made heirs of his covenant and distinguished from the children
  of the impious, were called a holy seed. For this same reason the children
  of Christians are considered holy; and even though born with only one
  believing parent, by the apostle&rsquo;s testimony they differ from the
  unclean seed of idolators. Now seeing that the Lord immediately after making
  the covenant with Abraham commanded it to be sealed in infants by an outward
  sacrament, what excuse will Christians give for not testifying and sealing
  it in their children today? (IV. 16. 6)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Because children in the Old Testament as well as in the
New Testament are a holy seed in virtue of the same covenantal promise made by
God with Abraham, infant baptism bears the same force of command as
circumcision.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><sup>[31]</sup></a>
Nor does Calvin accept the evasion that the children of the Old Testament
Covenant simply foreshadow the true children of Abraham of the New Covenant,
that is, believers.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32"
title=""><sup>[32]</sup></a> This <span class="page">[p. 222]</span>
cannot be, because of this ongoing covenant
that God established with Abraham:</p>

  <blockquote>In the use of the term &ldquo;children&rdquo; they find this
  difference: those who had their origin from his seed were called children of
  Abraham under the OT; now, those who imitate his faith are called by this
  name. They therefore say that that physical infancy which was engrafted into
  the fellowship of the covenant through circumcision foreshadowed the
  spiritual infants of the NT, who were regenerated to immortal life by
  God&rsquo;s Word. In these words, indeed, we see a feeble spark of truth.
  But those fickle spirits gravely sin in seizing upon whatever first comes to
  hand where they ought to proceed further, and in stubbornly clinging to one
  word where they ought to compare many things together. . . . We should,
  accordingly, aim at a better target, to which we are directed by the very
  sure guidance of Scripture. Therefore, the Lord promises Abraham that he
  will have offspring in whom all the nations of the earth will be blessed,
  and at the same time assures him that he will be his God and the God of his
  descendants. All those who by faith receive Christ as author of the blessing
  are heirs of this promise, and are therefore called children of Abraham.
  (IV. 16. 12)</blockquote>

<p>Calvin&rsquo;s point is that while there is an element of truth in the
objection, it does not fully explain all of the salient Scriptural data. It is
true that the offspring of Abraham&rsquo;s flesh foreshadowed the future
offspring of Abraham by faith. Yet, Calvin insists, this fact does not in the
least remove the promise that God made to Abraham&rsquo;s physical offspring.
God did in fact assure Abraham &ldquo;that he will be his God and the God of
his descendants.&rdquo; Calvin&rsquo;s response, then, is that it is not an
either/or, but a both/and. The implication for the practice of baptism is that
the offspring of Abraham are heirs of the promise, even those who become his
offspring by faith. Thus, even the children of Abraham&rsquo;s offspring by
faith are made full partakers of the promise made to Abraham, since they too
are now part of the family of Abraham. Calvin insists that the covenant with
Abraham does in fact exist in the New Covenant era.</p>

<p>One of the criticisms most often brought against Calvin&rsquo;s
argument for Paedobaptism due to the continuity of the covenant is that the
sign of circumcision has ceased. Since this is true, it is concluded that the
covenant signified by it is no longer valid in its original form. The covenant
of circumcision has changed even as the sign that characterized it has been
changed. From this, it would seem apparent that it is an invalid argument for
infant baptism. Calvin&rsquo;s simple answer to this challenge is that the
changing of the sign does not change the covenant.</p>

<span class="page">[p. 223]</span>

  <blockquote>And let no one object against me that the Lord did not command
  that his covenant be confirmed by any other symbol than circumcision, which
  has long since been abolished. There is a ready answer that for the time of
  the Old Testament he instituted circumcision, to confirm his covenant, but
  that after circumcision was abolished, the same reason for confirming his
  covenant (which we have in common with the Jews) still holds good.
  Consequently, we must always diligently consider what is common to both, and
  what they have apart from us. The covenant is common, and the reason for
  confirming it is common. Only the manner of confirmation is different
  &mdash; what was circumcision for them was replaced for us by baptism.
  (IV. 16. 6)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">In fact, Calvin goes on to argue, if it were true that
there is no replacement for circumcision since it was abolished, Christ&rsquo;s
coming actually narrowed the manifestation of God&rsquo;s grace rather than
increasing it:</p>

  <blockquote>Otherwise, if the testimony by which the Jews were assured of
  the salvation of their posterity is taken away from us, Christ&rsquo;s
  coming would have the effect of making God&rsquo;s grace more obscure and
  less attested for us than it had previously been for the Jews. Now, this
  cannot be said without grievously slandering Christ, through whom the
  Father&rsquo;s infinite goodness was more clearly and liberally poured out
  upon the earth and declared to men than ever before.
  (IV. 16. 6)</blockquote>

<p>Because the Anabaptist rejection of infant baptism often argued that
circumcision was not the spiritual equal of baptism, Calvin points out with
detail how Paul assumes the spirituality of the sign of circumcision
in opposition to their assertion:</p>

  <blockquote>Paul, also, therefore when he shows to the Ephesians out of what
  destruction the Lord has delivered them, from the fact that they had not
  been admitted into the covenant of circumcision infers that they were
  without Christ, without God, without hope, strangers to the testaments of
  promise &mdash; all of which the covenant itself contained. But the first
  access to God, the first entry into immortal life, is the forgiveness of
  sins. Accordingly, this corresponds to the promise of baptism that we shall
  be cleansed. Afterward, the Lord covenants with Abraham that he should walk
  before him in uprightness and innocence of heart. This applies to
  mortification, or regeneration. . . . Circumcision is the sign of
  mortification. . . As God when he adopts the posterity of Abraham as his
  people commands them to be circumcised, so Moses declares that they ought to
  be circumcised in heart, explaining the true meaning of this carnal
  circumcision. Again, that no man should strive after it by his own strength,
  Moses teaches that it is a work of God&rsquo;s grace. . . We have,
  therefore, a <span class="page">[p. 224]</span>
  spiritual promise given to the patriarchs in circumcision such
  as is given us in baptism, since it represented for them forgiveness of
  sins and mortification of flesh. Moreover, as we have taught that Christ is
  the foundation of baptism, in whom both of these reside, so it is evident
  that he is the foundation of circumcision. For he is promised to Abraham,
  and in him the blessing of all nations. To seal this grace, the sign of
  circumcision is added. (IV. 16. 3)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Calvin then turns this argument of the Anabaptists back
on themselves. If baptism and circumcision are paralleled by Paul, and
circumcision is only a material sign, then baptism as well must be a material
sign.</p>

  <blockquote>Clearly, if circumcision was a literal sign, we must estimate
  baptism to be the same. For the apostle, in the second chapter of
  Colossians, makes neither more spiritual than the other. . . . It is quite
  certain that the primary promises, which contained that covenant ratified
  with the Israelites by God under the Old Testament, were spiritual and
  referred to eternal life; then, conversely, that they were received by the
  fathers spiritually (as was fitting) in order that they might gain therefrom
  assurance of the life to come, to which they aspired with their whole heart.
  (IV. 16. 11)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">For Calvin, the Bible in its Old and New Testaments
insists in clear language that circumcision is a spiritual sign that signifies
all that baptism does. While the Bible speaks of the change of the sign, it
affirms the continuity of the covenant and the equivalence of the two signs.
Since baptism has taken the place of circumcision, it surely must be
administered in the same fashion as its counterpart: to infants of believers as
well as to new believers and their children.</p>

<p>While Calvin has asserted the covenantal arguments growing from
the continuity of the covenant and the parallel of circumcision and baptism, he
also argues for paedobaptism by the implications for the covenant and baptism
from Christ&rsquo;s attitude toward infants. Calvin writes:</p>

  <blockquote>If it is right for infants to be brought to Christ, why not also
  to be received into baptism, the symbol of our communion and fellowship with
  Christ? If the kingdom of heaven belongs to them, why is the sign denied
  which, so to speak, opens to them a door into the church, that adopted into
  it, they may be enrolled among the heirs of the kingdom of heaven? How
  unjust of us to drive away those whom Christ calls to himself! To deprive
  those whom he adorns with gifts! To shut out those whom he willingly
  receives! But if we wish to make an issue of the great difference between
  baptism and this act of Christ, how much more precious shall we regard
  baptism, by which we attest that infants are contained
  <span class="page">[p. 225]</span> within God&rsquo;s
  covenant, than the receiving, embracing, laying on of hands, and prayer, by
  which Christ himself present declares both that they are his and are
  sanctified by him? (IV. 16. 7)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">His argument in essence is that regardless of how
different the actions of Christ&rsquo;s embracing infants and infants being
baptized may appear to be, their significance is identical. Calvin&rsquo;s
concluding question must be answered by &ldquo;none at all.&rdquo; Being
received into the covenant (baptism) and being embraced by Christ and thus
sanctified are not capable of being interpreted as the Anabaptists attempt. To
them baptism is a blessing of a far greater sort than being brought to Christ.
But how can this be since each implies the full acceptance and sanctification
of Christ? What Calvin has done with this argument is to change the comparison
from a greater spiritual reality (baptism) and a lesser spiritual reality
(reception by Christ), to simply a matter about the external mode of offering
the child to Christ. If the two actions imply the same thing, then there is no
reason to prohibit infants from the sign of baptism on the ground that the
unbelieving child is not entitled to the sign of spiritual grace. This is
because Christ has made abundantly clear that infants are received by him, and
that to such belongs the kingdom of heaven. Of course, the paedobaptist cannot
find any water in this text. But, this is simply a matter of externals at this
point since the spiritual equivalence of Christ&rsquo;s embracing infants and
baptism has been established, which is the most critical point. The propriety
of water for infants is established by the continuity of the covenant and the
replacement of circumcision by baptism. Baptism, almost needless to say,
implies water.  For Calvin, then, Christ&rsquo;s embracing infants and
promising them the kingdom of heaven is tantamount to attesting &ldquo;that
infants are contained within God&rsquo;s covenant.&rdquo; For Calvin, the arms
of Christ are the arms of the covenanting God. This episode from the life of
Christ corroborates the legitimacy of infant baptism for Calvin.</p>

<p>Calvin&rsquo;s concluding positive argument for infant baptism by
the covenant is the great blessing for parents and children that results from
this administration of the covenant sign, as well as the accompanying danger
inherent in the delay of the administration of the sign. Calvin explains:</p>

  <blockquote>Accordingly, let those who embrace the promise that God&rsquo;s
  mercy is to be extended to their children deem it their duty to offer them to
  the church to be sealed by the symbol of mercy, and thereby to arouse
  themselves to a surer confidence, because they see with their very eyes the
  covenant of the Lord engraved upon the bodies
  <span class="page">[p. 226]</span> of their children. On the other
  hand, the children receive some benefit from their baptism: being engrafted
  into the body of the church, they are greatly spurred to an earnest zeal for
  worshiping God, by whom they were received as children through a solemn
  symbol of adoption before they were old enough to recognize him as Father.
  Finally, we ought to be greatly afraid of that threat, that God will wreak
  vengeance upon any man who disdains to mark his child with the symbol of the
  covenant; for by such contempt the proffered grace is refused, and, as it
  were, foresworn. (IV. 16. 9)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">The parents benefit in the confidence gained by visibly
seeing God&rsquo;s covenant promise attested. The children benefit by nurture
in the church and later by the humble joy of realizing that God had made them
His own even before they chose Him. Infant baptism is thus a graphic
representation of the sovereign grace of God &mdash; He loved us before we
loved Him. Further, the danger of spurning the promised grace of God is not
only wicked, but a risk that no believer should take.</p>

<p>Not only does Calvin defend infant baptism by employment of the
covenant idea, but he also resists the arguments that oppose paedobaptism by
constant reference to the covenant. The first example of this comes from the
Anabaptist charge that God&rsquo;s sovereign election and rejection of Israel
in the Old Covenant disproves any validity for the practice of infant baptism
by the argument from circumcision. Calvin presents the objection:</p>

  <blockquote>But they will bring forward in opposition another passage of the
  apostle, where he teaches that those who are of the flesh are not children
  of Abraham, but that only those who are children of promise are counted among
  his offspring. This seems to hint that physical descent from Abraham, to
  which we give some place, is nothing. (IV. 16. 14)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Calvin&rsquo;s response begins with an affirmation of
divine sovereign grace in election. He then points out that this election of
Israel was not a grounds for complacency on their part since the covenant
demands obedience to its stipulations:</p>

  <blockquote>Paul cites, by way of proof, Ishmael and Esau, who were rejected
  just as if they were strangers; even though they were real offspring of
  Abraham according to the flesh, the blessing rests on Isaac and Jacob. From
  this follows what he afterwards affirms, that salvation depends upon
  God&rsquo;s mercy, which he extends to whom he pleases; but that there is no
  reason for the Jews to preen themselves and boast in the name of the
  covenant unless they keep the law of the covenant, that is, obey the Word.
  (IV. 16. 14)</blockquote>

<span class="page">[p. 227]</span>

<p class="non-indent">In saying this, Calvin once again affirms his recognition
that those who have had a place in the covenant, can in fact fall away as
covenant-breakers, and this can in fact be traced back to the divine election.
But does this certain fact of Scripture set aside the divine promise to Israel
made in His covenant with Israel&rsquo;s father Abraham? To this Calvin
responds with an emphatic &ldquo;no.&rdquo; He explains:</p>

  <blockquote>Nevertheless, when Paul cast them down from vain confidence in
  their kindred, he still saw, on the other hand, that the covenant which God
  had made once for all with the descendants of Abraham could in no way be made
  void. . . For this reason, despite their stubbornness and covenant-breaking,
  Paul still calls them holy (such great honor does he give to the holy
  generation whom God had held worthy of his sacred covenant). . . Therefore,
  that they might not be defrauded of their privilege, the gospel had to be
  announced to them first. For they are, so to speak, like the first-born in
  God&rsquo;s household. Accordingly, this honor was to be given them until
  they refused what was offered, and by their ungratefulness caused it to be
  transferred to the Gentiles. (IV. 16. 14)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">In essence, Calvin here insists that Israel has broken
covenant, yet God continues to stand faithful to His promise made to Abraham.
As a result of this perspective, Calvin is able to assert that
physical Jews are in fact children of the covenant by right of birth, but if
they do not keep the obligations of the covenant, they lose the reality of the
covenant blessing. Even though only true believers are members of the covenant
in its fullest sense, God still holds forth his promise to covenant-breaking
Israel. The condition of restoration to the covenant is repentance:</p>

  <blockquote>However the covenant might be violated by them, the symbol of
  the covenant remained ever firm and inviolable by virtue of the Lord&rsquo;s
  institution. Therefore, on the sole condition of repentance they were
  restored into the covenant which God had once made with them in
  circumcision; and which, moreover, they had received at the hand of a
  covenant-breaking priest, and then done their utmost to defile and render
  ineffectual. (IV. 15 .17)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Calvin then goes on to show that his view that the
physical offspring of Abraham have a right to the covenant in spite of their
covenant-breaking is supported by the perspective of the New Testament itself.
He writes:</p>

  <blockquote>The apostle writes that &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; is &ldquo;a
  minister of the circumcision, to fulfill the promises which had been given
  to the fathers.&rdquo; Speaking <span class="page">[p. 228]</span>
  thus, he does not philosophize as subtly as
  if he had spoken in this fashion: &ldquo;Inasmuch as the covenant made with
  Abraham applies to his descendants, Christ, to perform and discharge the
  pledge made once for all by his Father, came for the salvation of the Jewish
  nation.&rdquo; Do you see how, after Christ&rsquo;s resurrection also, he
  thinks that the promise of the covenant is to be fulfilled, not only
  allegorically but literally, for Abraham&rsquo;s physical offspring? To the
  same point that the benefit of the gospel belongs to them and their
  offspring by right of the covenant; and in the following chapter he calls
  them &ldquo;sons of the covenant,&rdquo; that is, heirs.
  (IV, 16. 15)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Calvin&rsquo;s answer to this objection made by the
Anabaptists is that the reality of covenant-breaking does not set aside the
promise of God to the physical seed of Abraham. The promise still stands if
they repent or not. The blessing of the covenant is only received, however, if
they do repent. Thus Calvin points out that election can only be spoken of in
any specific case by its fruits. Only the children of promise are truly the
children of Abraham, but they are known only by their keeping the &ldquo;laws
of the covenant.&rdquo; The promise of God, however, is unchanging and is open
to all of Abraham&rsquo;s seed if they claim it in their human responsibility,
and thus keep the covenant as those marked out by promise as &ldquo;sons of the
covenant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A second major criticism against paedobaptism that Calvin answers
by use of the covenant is the Anabaptist argument that New Testament baptism
demands mental awareness of the significance of the act, that is, a spiritual
understanding by conscious faith.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"
title=""><sup>[33]</sup></a> Calvin&rsquo;s answer is that the child grows
into an understanding of his baptism. What is important is that circumcision
was not an act that placed no significance on understanding, and yet it was
used by God to seal His covenant. Calvin reasons:</p>

  <blockquote>But they repeatedly go wrong through their deluded notion that
  the thing ought always to precede the sign in order of time. For the truth
  of circumcision too rested upon the same testimony of a good conscience. But
  if it ought of necessity to have preceded, infants would never have been
  circumcised by God&rsquo;s command. Still, in showing that the testimony of
  a good conscience underlies the truth of circumcision, yet at the same time
  commanding the infants to be circumcised, he clearly indicates that
  circumcision is conferred, in this case, for the time to come. Accordingly,
  in infant baptism nothing more of present effectiveness must be
  <span class="page">[p. 229]</span> required
  than to confirm and ratify the covenant made with them by the Lord. The
  remaining significance of this sacrament will afterward follow at such time
  as God himself foresees. (IV. 16. 21)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Since circumcision was a sign that demanded understanding
and yet God commanded His covenant to be sealed by it to infants who were
unconscious of its import, the same must hold for baptism. Calvin thus argues
that the sign is to confirm and ratify the covenant promise, which will later
be experienced by the infant as God&rsquo;s sovereign purpose has already
determined.</p>

<p>Further, Calvin asserts that it is a basic misunderstanding
of Scripture to treat children and adults in the same fashion. This is seen in
the differing way new converts to Judaism in the Old Covenant were given
circumcision as opposed to the manner of giving circumcision to infants. Calvin
says:</p>

  <blockquote>But it is perfectly clear that infants ought to be put in
  another category, for in ancient times if anyone joined himself in religious
  fellowship with Israel, he had to be taught the Lord&rsquo;s covenant and
  instructed in the law before he could be marked with circumcision, because
  he was of foreign nationality, that is, alien to the people of Israel, with
  whom the covenant, which circumcision sanctioned, had been made.
  (IV. 16. 23)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Calvin then goes on to illustrate this difference between
adults and infants by the examples of Abraham and Isaac. God declares His
covenant to Abraham before the sign was given since in his case it was
dependent on faith. This, however, was not the case with Isaac. Calvin
interprets this in terms of an adult&rsquo;s coming into the covenant from the
outside and an infant&rsquo;s receiving the promise of the covenant by
hereditary right:</p>

  <blockquote>The Lord also, when he adopts Abraham, does not begin with
  circumcision, meanwhile concealing what he means by that sign, but first
  declares what the covenant is that he intends to make with him, then after
  Abraham has faith in the promise, the Lord makes him partaker in the
  sacrament. Why, in Abraham&rsquo;s case, does the sacrament follow faith,
  but in Isaac, his son, precede all understanding? Because it is fair that he
  who as a grown man is received into the fellowship of the covenant to which
  he had been till then a stranger should learn its conditions beforehand; but
  is not the same with his infant son. The latter by hereditary right,
  according to the form of the promise is already included within the covenant
  from his mother&rsquo;s womb. Or (to put the matter more clearly and
  briefly), if the children of believers are partakers in the covenant without
  the help of understanding, there is no reason why they should be barred from
  the sign merely because they cannot swear
  <span class="page">[p. 230]</span> to the provisions of the covenant.
  (IV. 16. 24)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">Having shown this basic distinction between adult and
infant in covenant with God, Calvin proceeds to clarify how an adult unbeliever
is outside of the benefits of the covenant. Then, Calvin contrasts this with
the right an infant of believers has in the covenant:</p>

  <blockquote>But he who is an unbeliever, sprung from impious parents, is
  reckoned as alien to the fellowship of the covenant until he is joined to God
  through faith. No wonder, then, if he does not partake in the sign when what
  is signified would be fallacious and empty in him! Paul also writes to this
  effect: that the Gentiles, so long as they were immersed in their idolatry,
  were outside the covenant. The whole matter, unless I am mistaken, can be
  clearly disclosed in this brief statement. Those who embrace faith in Christ
  as grown men, since they were previously strangers to the covenant, are not
  to be given the badge of baptism unless they first have faith and repentance,
  which alone can give access to the society of the covenant. But those infants
  who derive their origin from Christians, as they have been born directly into
  the inheritance of the covenant, and are expected by God, are thus to be
  received into baptism. (IV. 16. 24)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">With this development of the believer&rsquo;s entering
the covenant as an adult by faith, and the simultaneous inclusion of his
children by right of the covenant, Calvin believes that he has successfully
answered the Anabaptist argument of the universal necessity of faith before the
administration of baptism.</p>

<p>Calvin concludes his analysis of paedobaptism with a denial
and an affirmation. He first denies that his doctrine of infant baptism implies
that all unbaptized are lost. Having said this, however, Calvin nevertheless
resists the implication that baptism is unimportant. To despise baptism is to
despise God&rsquo;s covenant:</p>

  <blockquote>The promise of the Lord is clear: &ldquo;Whosoever believes in
  the Son will not see death, nor come into judgment, but has passed from
  death into life.&rdquo; Nowhere do we find that he has ever condemned anyone
  as yet unbaptized. I do not want anyone on this account to think of me as
  meaning that baptism can be despised with impunity (by which contempt I
  declare the Lord&rsquo;s covenant will be violated &mdash; so far am I from
  tolerating it!); it merely suffices to prove that baptism is not so necessary
  that one from whom the capacity to obtain it has been taken away should
  straightway be counted as lost. (IV. 16. 26)</blockquote>

<p class="non-indent">In these words, Calvin is attempting to insist on the
necessity of <span class="page">[p. 231]</span>
baptism without giving room to the idea of baptismal regeneration
or the saving efficacy of baptism. It is worthy of note that the necessity of
baptism arises out of the need to keep rather than violate God&rsquo;s
covenant.</p>

<h2>IV. Summary and Conclusion</h2>

<p>Our study has been designed to highlight Calvin&rsquo;s use of the concept
of the covenant as he responded to the Anabaptist view of baptism.
Calvin&rsquo;s general perspective can be summarized in three propositions.
<em>First</em>, there is one covenant of grace throughout all of Scripture,
both Old and New Testaments. If this is denied, either we must hold that the
Old Testament saints are robbed of salvation and received only material
benefits, or else we are left with the contradiction of affirming the
salvation of the Old Testament believers who nevertheless did not have a
spiritually significant sacrament.</p>

<p><em>Second</em>, there are differences in the Old and New Testaments when
they are compared. These differences are with respect to
administration and externals but not substance. Thus the main differences are
bound up in promise and fulfillment. With this viewpoint, Calvin naturally
unfolds the distinction of the Old and New Covenant as primarily one of
comparison of the lesser to the greater since the blessings of the New Covenant
have always existed either in terms of promise or in terms of fulfillment. Thus
too, Calvin sees that the church is made up of those who can in reality break
covenant in hypocrisy since the departure of people marked by the covenant in
the Old Testament is a reality for people of the New Testament. While the elect
can never fall, the warnings must be taken seriously due to the weakness of the
flesh.</p>

<p><em>Third</em>, baptism is an expression of the continuity of
the covenant in that infants are still included within the covenant, as well as
an expression of the discontinuity of the covenant since circumcision has
ceased and has been replaced by baptism. In expounding this doctrine, Calvin
shows that the covenant is its center. It is the explanation of Christ&rsquo;s
embracing arms, as well as the comfort of believing parents. The covenant
stands fast even if Israel or the church falls away since the promise of God
made in baptism can be renewed by true repentance. It is entrance into the
covenant that explains why some must believe first before administration of the
sacrament and others receive it before faith &mdash; adults enter by faith,
infants enter by birth into the promise. While salvation does not demand
baptism, nevertheless, not to baptize one&rsquo;s children is to
<span class="page">[p. 232]</span> violate
God&rsquo;s covenant. Obedience to God requires the baptism of one&rsquo;s
children and in this sense baptism is necessary.</p>

<p>While Calvin&rsquo;s interpretation of the sacrament of baptism may be
distasteful to many, it must not be thought of as an irrelevant or minute
part of his theology. Baptism means covenant to Calvin, and covenant means
almost everything else! To preserve the Calvinian system, paedobaptism is not
an option but a prerequisite. It is thus clear that Calvin&rsquo;s answer to
the Anabaptist perspective on baptism was that they failed to understand this
foundational doctrine of the covenant between God and his people and their
children.</p>

Several examples of Reformed or Calvinistic Baptists can be given to illustrate
their abrupt about-face in their attitude toward Calvin&rsquo;s theology when
the question of paedobaptism arises. Charles Spurgeon wrote, &ldquo;If I
thought it wrong to be a Baptist, I should give it up and become what I
believed to be right. If we could find infant baptism in the Word of God, we
would adopt it. It would help us out of a great difficulty, for it would take
away from us that reproach which is attached to us &mdash; that we are odd and
do not as other people do. But we have looked well through the Bible and cannot
find it, and do not believe it is there; nor do we believe that others can find
infant baptism in the Scripture, unless they themselves first put it
there,&rdquo; <em>Autobiography I</em>, London: Passmore and Alabaster,
1899&ndash;1900, cited by Paul K. Jewett, <em>Infant Baptism &amp; the Covenant
of Grace</em> (Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1978), p. v.
G. Beasley&ndash;Murray, <em>Baptism in the New Testament</em> (Grand Rapids:
Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1962), p. 339 writes, &ldquo;it is difficult to see how this
view [the Reformed view] is reconcilable with the teaching of Paul on the
covenant in Galatians 3.&rdquo; The greatest of the Reformed Baptist
theologians John Gill wrote, &ldquo;It is not fact, as has been asserted, that
the infants of believers have, with their parents, been taken into covenant
with God in the <em>former ages</em> of the church if by it is meant the
covenant of grace,&rdquo; (italics mine) in <em>A Body of Divinity</em> (Grand
Rapids: Sovereign Grace Publishers, 1971), p. 903. Jewett describes
Calvin&rsquo;s view as &ldquo;a study in paradox&rdquo; (p. 99) and as a
&ldquo;palpable incongruity&rdquo; (p. 100).</p>


<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>
Again, several examples of this sentiment can be found. A. H. Strong in his
<em>Systematic Theology</em> (New York: A. C Armstrong &amp; Son, 1889), p. 538
writes, &ldquo;There is therefore no logical halting place between the Baptist
and the Romanist positions. The Roman Catholic Archbishop Hughes of New York,
said well to a Presbyterian minister, &lsquo;We have no controversy with you,
our controversy is with the Baptists.&rsquo; Lange of Jena: &lsquo;Would the
Protestant Church fulfill and attain to its final destiny, the baptism of
infants must of necessity be abolished.&rsquo;&rdquo; William R. Estep,
<em>The <span class="page">[p. 186]</span> Anabaptist Story</em> (Grand Rapids:
Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1975), p. 145 writes, &ldquo;Luther&rsquo;s battle cry,
&lsquo;Justification by faith,&rsquo; became his plumb line for interpreting
the Bible. However, due to the persistent Roman Catholic appendages of his
theology, he was never able to give this truth consistent expression.&rdquo;
James A, Kirkland, <em>The People Called Baptists</em> (Texarkana: Bogard
Press, 1971), p. 28 states, &ldquo;The Reformation was not a full return to New
Testament teachings. The Protestants brought some of Rome&rsquo;s errors,
modified somewhat, into their new churches.&rdquo; Again on p. 29, he writes,
&ldquo;The Reformers refused to renounce Roman Baptism.&rdquo; Jewett&rsquo;s
remarks imply a similar merging of Catholic and Protestant thought at this
juncture, &ldquo;Confronted with this argument from ancient custom, early
Baptists used to remind their Paedobaptist brethren that subjects of the triple
crown are fond of tradition, and that it ill becomes a Protestant to cry,
&lsquo;The Fathers, the Fathers,&rsquo;&rdquo; p. 15.</p>


<p><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a>
Kirkland writes, &ldquo;When the Anabaptists saw that the Reformers were
halting short of a full return to the New Testament faith, they separated
completely from the Reformation movement&rdquo; (p. 30). C. E. Tulga writes in
<em>Why Baptists are Not Protestants</em>, &ldquo;Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli
considered them heretics and consented and sometimes encouraged their
punishment and death as heretics. The Reformers must share with the Roman
Catholics the responsibility for the bloody persecution and death of a great
host of Anabaptists. It is true that the history of the Baptists can be traced
by their bloody footprints on the sands of time; it is also true that the hands
of the Reformers are stained with the blood of many of the saints of God who
dared to stand by the Word of God and oppose their sinful compromises.&rdquo;
Cited by Kirkland, p. 30.</p>

<p>While the point of these citations is to illustrate the baptistic conception
of their role in &ldquo;completing the Reformation,&rdquo; it also raises the
question of the problem of persecution. First, it must be admitted that both
Rome and the original &ldquo;Protestants&rdquo; at the Diet of Speyer in 1529
joined in reenacting the death penalty for rebaptism as provided by the
Justinian Code. Yet, this was not the standard practice. Luther for several
years refused to accept the notion that the sword could be brought in defense
of the gospel and thus advocated exile as the extreme form of punishment.
Later, in the wake of what he viewed as seditious activities, he allowed for
capital punishment as a means of restraining Anabaptist threats to the social
order. It is well known that Zwingli executed Anabaptists. The reason, however,
appears to be less theological than political. In view of their official defeat
at the two baptismal disputations against Zwingli in Zurich, their continued
activities were seen as directly contrary to the authority of the civil
leaders. Once this became a repeated pattern of resistance, the death penalty
was imposed. While it can be argued that religious tolerance should have
pervaded, it must also be admitted that in that age, Zwingli was carrying out
his understanding of obedience to the civil order.</p>

<p>Martin Bucer, the theological mentor of Calvin, is undoubtedly the best
example of religious toleration among the early Reformers.  He sought to
exercise Christian love and acceptance if this was mutually shared by both the
Reformed and the Anabaptists. If this proved impossible, the penalty was not
then death, but rather exile. Bucer&rsquo;s attitude two years after the Diet
of Speyer is well illustrated in his letter written to Margaret Blaurer on
September 19, 1531, concerning Pilgram Marpeck: &ldquo;What is the view of your
Anabaptist of whom you write to me but that of the ancient
<span class="page">[p. 187]</span> Cyprian who wanted to rebaptize all those
who had been baptized by heretics! And if he does not condemn other churches,
neither do the others condemn him. Heresy is not this or that fancy or error at
all, but a disease of the flesh which presumes to adopt a better doctrine or
life (only in appearance) than that of the common church&rsquo;s divine
practice, and therefore separates from the church and a separatist gang and
sect is formed. They want to be better than other people but in love they are
grossly lacking.&rdquo; Cited by John C. Wegner in the <em>Mennonite Quarterly
Review</em>, XII, 148. Bucer had followed this policy with Marpeck, but after
repeated confrontations, exile was imposed.</p>


<p><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a>
This is illustrated by the Reformed Baptist theology of John Gill. He is often
termed a &ldquo;Hyper-Calvinist&rdquo; due to his rejection of the free offer
of the gospel. Many of the historic Baptist confessions used in America are
quite consciously extracted from the <em>Westminster Confession of Faith</em>
excepting the articles on the doctrines of baptism, the church, and the
relationship of church and state. In fact, Paul Jewett in the early
1950&rsquo;s reissued the <em>Baptist Catechism</em> that was the same
catechism used by Spurgeon, &ldquo;the prince of Baptist Calvinists.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title="">[6]</a>
This conception of the discontinuity of the Old and New Covenants is repeatedly
seen not only in the early Anabaptists, but also in the modem Anti-paedobaptist
writings. For the Anabaptists&rsquo; writings, <em>cf.</em> George H. Williams,
<em>The Radical Reformation</em> (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1975),
pp. 828&ndash;32; Leonard Verduin, <em>The Reformers and Their
Stepchildren</em> (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1980), p. 209ff.; Jan J. Kiwiet,
<em>Pilgram Marbeck</em> (Kassel: J. G. Oncken Verlag, 1957), pp. 101, 102;
August Baur, <em>Zwinglis Theologie</em> (Halle: Max Niemeyer, 1889),
II:228&ndash;29. For modern Anti-paedobaptist writings, <em>cf.</em>
Beasley&ndash;Murray, <em>op. cit.</em>, pp. 337, 338; Estep, <em>op cit.</em>,
pp. 86, 87; Gill, <em>op. cit.</em>, p. 903; Jewett, <em>op. cit.</em>,
pp. 93, 96. Gill goes so far as to deny that the Abrahamic covenant was even a
covenant of grace! He writes, &ldquo;Now that this covenant was not the pure
covenant of grace, in distinction from the covenant of works, but rather a
covenant of works, will soon be proved; and if so, then the main ground of
infant&rsquo;s baptism is taken away.&rdquo; This reminds one of the efforts of
dispensationalists to discover two new covenants in the New Testament so that
their Church/Israel distinction can continue. <em>Cf.</em> John F. Walvoord,
<em>The Millennial Kingdom</em> (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1976), pp. 210, 218.
Gill goes on to argue that the covenant of grace referred to in Galatians 3
refers to God&rsquo;s covenant with Abraham in Genesis 12, but not to this
&ldquo;covenant of works&rdquo; in Genesis 17. Thus in both the Baptist and
Dispensationalist approaches, the clear teaching of the continuity of the Old
and New Covenants has compelled some of their writers to search out a
&ldquo;second&rdquo; covenant so that their structures might conform better to
the evidence.</p>


<p><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7" title="">[7]</a>
Calvin has in view here Servetus and some of the Anabaptists: &ldquo;Indeed,
that wonderful rascal Servetus and certain madmen of the Anabaptist sect, who
regard the Israelites as nothing but a herd of swine, make necessary what would
in any case have been very profitable for us&rdquo; (II. 10. 1). Not all
Anabaptists would have argued as perversely as Servetus. Nevertheless, as was
seen in the citation from IV. 16. 10, <span class="page">[p. 189]</span>
Calvin&rsquo;s point in this extended discussion is to show that this same
destructive view weighs on all Anabaptists as a logical result of their
insistence on distinguishing so absolutely the Old and New Testaments. Even if
it is denied, it must be done by an inherent logical inconsistency.</p>


<p><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8" title="">[8]</a>
It is often thought that Calvin paid little attention to the covenant idea, and
that covenant theology developed after the Reformation. <em>Cf.</em> Perry
Miller, <em>The New England Mind</em> (New York: The MacMillan Co., 1939), pp.
381, 389. Fred Lincoln, &ldquo;The Development of the Covenant Theory&rdquo;
<em>Bibliotheca Sacra</em> 100 (1943): 136 states, &ldquo;It was [covenant
theology], of course, unknown to the apostolic and early church fathers, never
taught by the church leaders of the middle ages, and <em>not mentioned</em>
even by any of the great teachers of the reformation period itself&rdquo;
(italics mine). Similarly, Charles C. Ryrie, <em>Dispensationalism Today</em>
(Chicago: Moody Press, 1965), p. 180, writes, &ldquo;Covenant theology does not
appear in the writings of Luther, Zwingli, Calvin or Melanchthon. They had
every opportunity to incorporate the covenant idea, but they did not. It is
true that Calvin, for instance, spoke of the continuity of redemptive
revelation and of the idea of a covenant between God and His people, but this
was not covenant theology.&rdquo; While Ryrie indicates an advance on
Lincoln&rsquo;s &ldquo;not mentioned,&rdquo; he still insists that there is no
covenant theology in Calvin.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best response to this assertion is to point out the frequency of
the covenant idea in Calvin&rsquo;s writings and the general contexts where
Calvin makes important use of the idea. Calvin uses in the 1559 edition of the
<em>Institutes</em> the Latin terms <em>Pactum</em> 35x, <em>Foedus</em> 154x,
and <em>Testamentum</em> 84x, for a total of 273x. As we shall see, Calvin
makes great use of the idea of the covenant in the context of the relationship
of the Old and New Covenants and sacraments (53x in IV. 16 in his discussion of
infant baptism alone!). In addition, he uses the idea in several texts: on the
law &mdash; II. 8 (7x), on faith &mdash; III. 2 (2x), on prayer &mdash;
III. 20 (1lx), on repentance &mdash; once each in III. 4. 32, IV. 1. 27,
IV. 15. 17. His discussion of justification uses the concept 13x in III. 17.
His analysis of election uses the idea 12x in III. 21. This is remarkable since
many see the covenant as an idea that is antithetical to the doctrine of
election! He also uses the idea of the covenant as a justification of the
Protestant Reformation against Rome in IV. 2. 11, IV. 7. 30, IV. 8. 2,
IV. 9. 2, IV. 18. 15. I personally <span class="page">[p. 190]</span> believe
that Calvin taught an inchoative doctrine of works as well. <em>Cf.</em> the
Spring 1981 edition of the <em>Westminster Theological Journal</em> where I
seek to defend this in an article entitled, &ldquo;Ursinus&rsquo; Development
of the Covenant of Creation: A Debt to Melanchthon or Calvin?&rdquo;
Considering the fact that the Bible only uses the covenant idea 314x, and even
Dispensationalists give a great deal of attention to this idea, it does not
seem quite accurate to say that Calvin&rsquo;s teaching at this point
&ldquo;was not covenant theology!&rdquo; He did in fact teach a covenant of
grace and a covenant of works, as well as make extensive use of idea in a wide
range of contexts.</p>


<p><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9" title="">[9]</a>
That Calvin understands this &ldquo;law&rdquo; and &ldquo;covenant&rdquo; that
have existed from the &ldquo;beginning of the world&rdquo; to include Adam in
his unfallen state is seen in the fact that the moral law is equivalent to
man&rsquo;s conscience and natural law: &ldquo;. . . the very things contained
in the two tablets are in a way dictated to us by that internal law written and
stamped on every heart,&rdquo; (II. 8. l) and &ldquo;. . . the law of God,
which we call moral, is nothing other than the testimony of the natural law and
of that conscience which God has engraved on the minds of men&rdquo;
(IV. 20. 6). This is important evidence for the question of whether Calvin
taught a pre-fall covenant with Adam. It appears from this that he
<em>did</em>.</p>


<span class="page">[p. 191]</span>

<p><a href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10" title="">[10]</a>
In view of Calvin&rsquo;s clear understanding of redemptive history as revealed
by this text, the charge that he failed to discern any progress in revelation
cannot be legitimately lodged against him. <em>Cf.</em> Ryrie,
<em>op. cit.</em>, p. 19. In fact, this emphasis on the history of redemption
led some <em>Anabaptists</em> to criticize the Reformed theology at this point.
<em>Cf.</em> II. 11. 13 and note 17. The real state of the question is whether
there is progress in <em>unity</em> (Reformed viewpoint) or progress by
<em>discontinuity</em> (Anabaptists, Baptists, Dispensationalists)?</p>


<p><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11" title="">[11]</a>
Besides the use of the covenant in the context of justification in III. 17
mentioned above, <em>cf.</em> the following passages in the commentaries: Gen.
7:1, Dt. 30:11, Ps. 18:20, 19:11, Ezk. 14:14, 18:17, 20:11, Mal. 3:17,
Luke 1:6, 17:10.</p>


<span class="page">[p. 192]</span>

<p><a href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12" title="">[12]</a>
One of Calvin&rsquo;s great themes in II. 6&ndash;11 is that eternal life is
the great benefit of the covenant regardless of what point in the history of
redemption one is discussing. In Psalm 67:2 Calvin calls the covenant
&ldquo;the source and spring of salvation.&rdquo; In Zech. 12:1 he says that
the &ldquo;hope of salvation is founded on the covenant.&rdquo;</p>


<span class="page">[p. 194]</span>

<p><a href="#_ftnref13" name="_ftn13" title="">[13]</a>
Modern Anti-paedobaptists continue to reject the equivalence of the spiritual
significance of circumcision and baptism by their insistence on the material
blessings associated with circumcision, although they affirm emphatically the
existence of salvation in the Old Testament. <em>Cf.</em> Gill,
<em>op. cit.</em>, p. 903, Beasley&ndash;Murray, <em>op. cit.</em>, p. 341,
Jewett, <em>op. cit.</em>, pp. 95, 97. While many Baptists do not espouse
dispensationalism, this strong emphasis on God&rsquo;s covenant and material
blessings is a fundamental argument for the dispensation scheme of an eternal
&ldquo;earthly people&rdquo; and &ldquo;heavenly people.&rdquo; <em>Cf.</em>
Lewis Sperry Chafer, <em>Dispensationalism</em> (Dallas: Dallas Seminary Press,
1951), pp. 32&ndash;33, 107. <em>If</em> the material blessings of the covenant
share an equal importance with the spiritual, and <em>if</em> there is such a
profound difference between the testaments as the Anti-paedobaptists argue,
then the dispensational interpretation appears rather convincing! While Chafer
was a paedobaptist (<em>Cf.</em> Lewis Sperry Chafer, <em>Systematic
Theology</em> [Dallas: Dallas Seminary Press, 1948], VII 34&ndash;43), his
rejection of the covenant theology and hence the equation of the spiritual
significance of the two signs leaves little more than the household baptism
texts in its defense. It is little wonder that he makes the matter of the
subjects of baptism an unimportant issue in the church (<em>cf.</em> VII:34,
&ldquo;. . . the consideration of ritual baptism cannot be eliminated, though
to do so would be easier and to avoid countering good men would in itself be
desirable.&rdquo;). Nor is it surprising that dispensational schools are today
essentially baptistic or in fact Baptist.</p>


<p><a href="#_ftnref14" name="_ftn14" title="">[14]</a>
Jewett, <em>op. cit.</em>, pp 89, 93, continually criticizes the Reformed
approach for its movement from the New to the Old. This seems rather strange
since the Reformed always resist that their viewpoint is the Old Testament
practice of circumcision in its spiritual implications being carried over into
the New (<em>cf.</em> Col. 2:10&ndash;12), or exactly the opposite of
Jewett&rsquo;s contention. Jewett makes this charge because he believes that
the Paedobaptists&rsquo; contention that faith was always a requirement for
circumcision is not substantiated by the cases of the circumcision of
Abraham&rsquo;s household, Ishmael and the sons of Keturah, and the practice of
Old Testament Israel. This requirement, he says, is reading the requirement of
New Testament baptism back into Old Testament circumcision. Thus the Reformed
viewpoint reads the Old Testament as though it were the New. Yet, in each case,
this approach fails to secure its point. In the cases of Abraham&rsquo;s
household and thus Ishmael and later the <span class="page">[p. 195]</span>
sons of Keturah, it is precisely Abraham&rsquo;s faith as a covenantal head of
the household that allows this sign to be administered.</p>

<p>In respect to Israel, faith was still required although as Calvin points out
so forcefully, hypocrisy often took the place of true faith: &ldquo;He says,
that the Israelites had transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and conducted
themselves perfidiously against his law. He repeats the same thing twice, for
the covenant and the law are synonymous: only the word, law, in my view, is
added as explanatory, as though he had said, that they had violated the
covenant of the Lord, which had been sanctioned or sealed by the law. God then
had made a covenant with Israel, which he designed to be comprehended in the
tables. Since then it was not unknown to the Israelites what they owed to God,
they were covenant-breakers. It was then the doubling of their crime, as the
Prophet shows, that they had not fallen through mistake when they transgressed
the covenant of the Lord, for they had been more than sufficiently taught by
the law what faith and what purity the Lord required of them. At the same time,
the covenant which the Lord so openly made with them was yet neglected&rdquo;
(Hosea 8:1). Note below Calvin&rsquo;s comments on Gen. 21:12.</p>

<p>The point really is that Jewett is refusing to see that it is the New
Testament itself that presents baptism as the legitimate expression of the
spiritual reality of the Old Testament practice of circumcision. Contrary to
Jewett&rsquo;s assertion, Paedobaptists do not try to turn Old Testament
circumcision into New Testament baptism. Rather, they accept the fact that the
New Testament itself declares that baptism <em>is</em> circumcision, in their
proper spiritual meanings. So then, even though Jewett is bothered by all the
paedobaptists who repeatedly &ldquo;intone such conventions as
&lsquo;circumcision was not exclusively a national sign,&rsquo;&rdquo; he
nevertheless must not only admit this fact (which he does, p. 89), but must
also come to grips with its implications. Jewett is entirely correct that the
history of redemption has shown us that the material aspects of circumcision
have been jettisoned in its New Testament form of baptism. Nevertheless, it is
precisely the history of redemption that demands the spiritual equivalency of
the two sacraments! If the Old Testament sign which was fraught with such
spiritual significance and was demanded by God to be given to infants who yet
could not consciously believe (as Jewett himself forcefully argues), then how
can the validity of infant baptism be gainsaid? Thus, the Paedobaptist does not
make the error of reading the Old Testament as if it were the New. He reads the
New in light of its own expression of its relationship of continuity with the
Old. Rather, it is the Anti-paedobaptist who reads the New Testament in
discontinuity with the Old Testament and with itself.</p>

This might be termed the &ldquo;sacramental&rdquo; character of the land. This
idea is well developed by Philip E, Hughes, <em>Interpreting Prophecy</em>
(Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1976), pp. 41&ndash;44. This is undoubtedly one
of the chief hermeneutical principles for the amillennial interpretation of
Scripture.</p>


<span class="page">[p. 198]</span>

<p><a href="#_ftnref16" name="_ftn16" title="">[16]</a>
This point is argued by Lincoln, <em>op. cit.</em>, p 135, &ldquo;Therefore, in
spite of the multitude of texts which place the &lsquo;old covenant&rsquo; of
the law of Moses in direct contrast with the &lsquo;new covenant&rsquo; of
grace in Christ, showing that the one was a failure and the other superseded it
(comp. Jer. 31:31&ndash;34; Heb. 8:7&ndash;12, etc.), in order to maintain the
unbroken continuity of the Covenant of Grace, they are forced to the
unscriptural and untenable position of saying that the law of Moses was a part
of the grace covenant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An interesting departure from historic Reformed covenant theology is that
viewpoint articulated by Meredith G. Kline, <em>By Oath Consigned</em> (Grand
Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1968), pp. 16&ndash;25. Kline in essence accepts the
viewpoint of dispensationalism in asserting that there is a fundamental
opposition of the covenant made at Sinai with that made with Abraham and
renewed by Christ. Hence, Kline articulates the law&ndash;gospel distinction as
portrayed by Lincoln as the difference between the
&ldquo;law&ndash;covenant&rdquo; and the &ldquo;promise&ndash;covenant.&rdquo;
In the &ldquo;law&ndash;covenant,&rdquo; God is not the one who swears to the
stipulations of the covenant, but only man. On the other hand, the
&ldquo;promise&ndash;covenant&rdquo; occurs without human stipulation but only
divine stipulation, or promise. While it is not our purpose to critique
Kline&rsquo;s perspective here, it is important to evaluate his use of Calvin
to justify his viewpoint. Kline <span class="page">[p. 199]</span> writes,
&ldquo;Calvin reflects the contrast in principle brought out by Paul when he
says that although promises of mercy are found in the law taken as a whole
(&lsquo;the whole law&rsquo;), they are borrowed elements there and &lsquo;are
not considered as part of the law when the mere nature of the law is the
subject of discussion.&rsquo;&rdquo; To begin with, it is worth quoting a
passage already cited above from II. 7. 1, &ldquo;And Moses was not made a
lawgiver to wipe out the blessing promised to the race of Abraham. Rather, we
see him repeatedly reminding the Jews of that freely given covenant made with
their fathers of which they were the heirs. It was as if he were sent to renew
it. This fact was very clearly revealed in the ceremonies.&rdquo; Here we see
Calvin asserting that Moses was one who renewed the covenant of grace made with
Abraham. Further, the very requirements of the law such as the ceremonies
illustrated the covenant of grace. Thus Kline&rsquo;s desire to make Calvin
affirm that the Sinai covenant was primarily law with a sprinkling of mercy is
out of accord with Calvin&rsquo;s fundamental understanding of the
covenant.</p>

<p>As to the point where Kline affirms that promises of mercy are
&ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; by the Old Covenant, we must carefully evaluate
Calvin&rsquo;s own thought to see if this faithfully reflects his viewpoint.
Perhaps no clearer passage in Calvin can be found than that of II. 9. 4:
&ldquo;Hence, also, we refute those who always erroneously compare the law with
the gospel by contrasting the merit of works with the free imputation of
righteousness. This is indeed a contrast not at all to be rejected. For Paul
often means by the term &lsquo;law&rsquo; the rule of righteous living by which
God requires of us what is his own, giving us no hope of life unless we
completely obey him, and adding on the other hand a curse if we deviate even in
the slightest degree. But the gospel did not so supplant the entire law as to
bring forward a different way of salvation. Rather, it confirmed and satisfied
whatever the law had promised, and gave substance to the shadows. From this we
infer that, where the whole law is concerned, the gospel differs from it only
in clarity of manifestation.&rdquo; In sum, Calvin&rsquo;s point is that there
is not an irreducible difference of merit versus grace between the Old and New
Covenants. Nor was there a different &ldquo;way of salvation&rdquo; implicit in
the law or the gospel. The difference was of degree of manifestation but not in
substance. Calvin&rsquo;s point in speaking of the &ldquo;whole law&rdquo; was
not to speak of it in some abnormal sense, but in its regular role in the
believer&rsquo;s life. It was Paul&rsquo;s taking the law in an
&ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; sense due to his opponents that results in the
law&ndash;gospel dichotomy in his theology. This point will be fully
illustrated in the discussion to follow. So Calvin can speak of the law in
separation from Christ or in union with Christ (<em>cf.</em> I. 9. 3) with the
latter&rsquo;s being normative. He also can speak of the &ldquo;restricted
sense.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whenever the word <em>law</em> is used in this restricted
sense, Moses is implicitly contrasted with Christ. We are then to see what the
law contains in itself when separated from the Gospel.&rdquo; (Rom. 10:4).</p>


<span class="page">[p. 200]</span>

<p><a href="#_ftnref17" name="_ftn17" title="">[17]</a>
The Lutheran conception is quite distinct from Calvin&rsquo;s view of the law
at this point. Commenting on Psalm 19, Luther writes, &ldquo;This psalm teaches
similarly that a new Word will be preached, namely, one that will go through
the whole world and save those who believe in it, for the Law of Moses was
given only to the Jews.&rdquo; (<em>Luther&rsquo;s Works</em>, 12:139) Again,
he says, &ldquo;For the Law reveals God&rsquo;s wrath and not God&rsquo;s grace
to us. Therefore now God is rightly known&rdquo; (<em>LW</em>, 12:140). Here
one can see that Luther interprets Psalm 19 as a prophecy of the Gospel to the
utter rejection of the law of Moses. Not only does this overlook entirely the
historical context of the Psalm, but it also shows the great difference between
Calvin and Luther at this point, For Calvin, the law is unquestionably the law
of Moses in terms of the moral law.</p>


<span class="page">[p. 201]</span>

<p><a href="#_ftnref18" name="_ftn18" title="">[18]</a>
This is well illustrated in Pilgram Marpeck&rsquo;s letter translated in the
<em>Mennonite Quarterly Review</em>, XXXII, 198&ndash;99. &ldquo;Ah, my
brethren, how diligently and carefully we have to take heed that we do not
consider our own impulse the impulse of the Holy Spirit, our own course the
course and walk of Christ. God also uses such servants now, often as a
provisional forerunner and preparer of the way for those who are rightly driven
of the Holy Spirit of Christ, that they may make the path and the road, clear
it, and weed it; they are however <em>only</em> servants and not friends or
children, who do not know what their master is doing nor what he has in mind.
Such a servile compulsion has taken place in our time, for quite a while now
and by contributing to all divisions and sects, in order that the righteous
driven by the Holy Spirit of Christ may become manifest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luther, Zwingli, M. Hofman, C. Schwenckfeld, S. Frank, and others
have been only servants who did not know what their Lord would do.&rdquo;
[This last line was printed in red for emphasis.] Just as the Old Testament
saints were only servants and not friends of God due to their not having the
Spirit, so also, Marpeck says that not only the Reformers but other Anabaptists
were without the Spirit and were also only servants while the true Anabaptists
were the friends due to their possession of the Holy Spirit. Williams points
out the interesting implications of this aspect of Marpeck&rsquo;s thought for
his view of the civil order: &ldquo;At issue with Bucer was Marpeck&rsquo;s
insistence that the freedom of the gospel should never be thrust upon the whole
<span class="page">[p. 202]</span> population, indeed that the untutored masses
in so far as they were incapable of self-discipline should remain under the
yoke of the law of the Old Covenant, Marpeck sought for the true,
self-discipling evangelicals (the Anabaptists) the public authorization of
their use of at least one of the church edifices of the city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Constitutive for such evangelical or truly New Covenantal church
living under the gospel rather than under the law was the acknowledgment of
personal sin, the entry into the New Covenant by believers&rsquo; baptism, and
the observance of the evangelical law. This meant expressly the separation from
the world, including the whole sphere of the law and its <em>legitimate but
subchristian</em> institutions such as the state.&rdquo; (pp. 274&ndash;75) In
light of this, one can also understand why the magistrates of the Reformation
period saw the Anabaptist movement as seditious and hence by definition
dangerous for the state.</p>


<span class="page">[p. 204]</span>

<p><a href="#_ftnref19" name="_ftn19" title="">[19]</a>
Calvin comments on Dt. 30:11: &ldquo;But this is the peculiar blessing of the
new covenant, that the Law is written on men&rsquo;s hearts, and engraven on
their inward parts, whilst that severe requirement is relaxed so that the vices
under which believers still labour are no obstacle to their partial and
imperfect obedience being pleasant to God.&rdquo; In light of this doctrine,
Calvin can go on to say that believers actually receive the promises of the
law, that is the reward promised to obedience, because of their being viewed in
light of the promises of the gospel. Calvin writes in III. 17. 3, &ldquo;But
when the promises of the gospel are substituted, which proclaim the free
forgiveness of sins, these not only make us acceptable to God but also render
our works pleasing to him. And not only does the Lord adjudge them pleasing; he
also <span class="page">[p. 205]</span> extends to them the blessings which
under the covenant were owed to the observance of his law. I therefore admit
that what the Lord has promised in his law to the keepers of righteousness and
holiness is paid to the works of believers, but in this repayment we must
always consider the reason that wins favor for these works.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this same context, a further criticism of Kline&rsquo;s viewpoint may be
discerned. Kline avers that &ldquo;the systematic theologian possesses [p. 25]
ample warrant to speak both of &lsquo;promise covenant&rsquo; and, in sharp
distinction from that, of &lsquo;law covenant,&rsquo;&rdquo; For Calvin,
however, this sharp distinction does not exist once God begins to exercise his
&ldquo;fatherly indulgence&rdquo; toward His people (<em>cf.</em>
<em>Commentaries on the Last Four Books of Moses</em>, III: 199&ndash;205, 214,
218, 227). See the references cited in note 11 as well.</p>

<p>Nor would Calvin accept the idea that the &ldquo;covenant of mercy&rdquo; or
Kline&rsquo;s covenant of promise does not include the believers&rsquo; oath of
obedience. First, Calvin insists that &ldquo;in all covenants of his mercy the
Lord requires of his servants in return uprightness and sanctity of life, lest
his goodness be mocked or someone, puffed up with empty exultation on that
account, bless his own soul, walking meanwhile in the wickedness of his own
heart. Consequently, in this way he wills to keep in their duty those admitted
to the fellowship of the covenant; nonetheless the covenant is at the outset
drawn up as a free agreement, and perpetually remains as such.&rdquo; Thus when
Calvin speaks of covenant, the condition of obedience remains.</p>

<p>In fact, Calvin resists that the covenant of grace still demands the perfect
obedience of the believer. Calvin explains in IV. 13. 6, &ldquo;All believers
have one common vow which, made in baptism, we confirm and, so to speak,
sanction by catechism and receiving the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. For the sacraments
are like contracts by which the Lord gives us his mercy and from it eternal
life, and we in turn promise him obedience. And there is no obstacle in the
fact that no one can maintain in this life <em>the perfect obedience to the law
which God requires of us. For inasmuch as this stipulation is included in the
covenant of grace</em> under which are contained both forgiveness of sins and
the spirit of sanctification, the promise which we make there is joined with a
plea for pardon and a petition for help&rdquo; (italics mine). Since the
&ldquo;vow&rdquo; or oath made in covenant of grace by baptism includes the
believer&rsquo;s obedience to the law, Calvin must be seen to be in deep
disagreement with the Kline perspective. Grace does not exempt absolute
obedience, rather it pardons imperfect obedience by the believer (&ldquo;plea
for pardon&rdquo;) and it enables the believer to begin to accomplish this goal
(&ldquo;petition for help&rdquo;).</p>


<p><a href="#_ftnref20" name="_ftn20" title="">[20]</a>
Calvin in his <em>Last Four Books of Moses</em>, III:199 says: &ldquo;Further,
because Paul <em>seems to abrogate the Law</em>, as if now-a-days it did not
concern believers, we must now see how far this is the case&rdquo; (italics
mine). Contrast this with what Melanchthon says, &ldquo;That part of the law
called the Decalogue or the moral commandments has been abrogated by the New
Testament.&rdquo; <em>Melanchthon and Bucer</em>, ed. Wilhelm Pauck
(Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1969), p. 121. Luther, in fact states,
&ldquo;The <span class="page">[p. 206]</span> greatest art of Christians is to
be ignorant of the whole of active righteousness and of the law; whereas
outside the people of God, the greatest wisdom is to know and to contemplate
the law. For if I do not remove the law from my sight and turn my thoughts to
grace, as though there were no law and only pure grace. I cannot be
blessed.&rdquo; Cited in Gerhard Ebeling, <em>Luther</em>, trans. R. A. Wilson
(Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1972), pp. 123&ndash;24. It should from this be
clear that Luther and Melanchthon understood that the law had been abrogated
even in the form of the moral law while Calvin believed that this was a
misreading of Scripture. Calvin insists that Paul only <em>seems</em> to
abrogate the law. While Luther would have the Christian ignorant of the law,
Calvin would remind them that the covenant of grace includes perfect obedience
to the law as one of its stipulations!</p>

I have counted over thirty examples in the <em>Institutes</em> alone where

Calvin employs his distinction between &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; and

<p><a href="#_ftnref29" name="_ftn29" title="">[29]</a>
As was mentioned above in note 8, Calvin utilizes the term covenant or
testament 53x in this chapter (IV. 16) alone. Karl Barth&rsquo;s criticisms of
Calvin&rsquo;s approach <span class="page">[p. 220]</span> at this point are
worth citing: &ldquo;I venture the affirmation: the confusion into which Luther
and Calvin and their respective disciples have tumbled headlong in this matter
is hopeless. Let anyone read chapters XV and XVI of Book IV of the
<em>Institutio</em> in order and convince himself where the great Calvin is
sure of his subject and where he obviously is not sure of it, but is patently
nervous, revolved in an exceedingly unperspicuous train of thought, scolding;
where he lectures when he should convince, seeks a way in the fog which can
lead him to no goal because he has none.&rdquo; Cited in Jewett, <em>op.
cit.</em>, p. 92. One can only remark that Barth&rsquo;s analysis does not
accord with Jewett&rsquo;s own frequent comment on how often Calvin&rsquo;s
various arguments have been employed by his theological descendants! If they
were that &ldquo;unperspicuous&rdquo; they would have been discarded long ago.
It also appears evident that Barth&rsquo;s deepest charge against Calvin that
his thought is a &ldquo;fog&rdquo; that leads him to a non-existent
&ldquo;goal&rdquo; is a direct negation of Calvin&rsquo;s fundamental concept
of covenant. Can one really believe that Barth faithfully reflects
Calvin&rsquo;s thought elsewhere if he so little appreciates and understands
Calvin&rsquo;s intense commitment to the doctrine of the covenant?</p>


<p><a href="#_ftnref30" name="_ftn30" title="">[30]</a>
Beasley&ndash;Murray addresses this question in a few words, <em>op. cit.</em>,
p. 343. His response attempts to use election as that which &ldquo;cuts right
across the distinctions of circumcision and uncircumcision: not all of Israel
are Israel (Ro  m. 9:7, Gal. 4:30).&rdquo; <span class="page">[p. 221]</span>
Because of this, he believes that Christian parents are not at an inferior
position than Old Testament parents. The failure of this response, however, is
that it once again sets at opposition the Old and New Testaments as if
God&rsquo;s electing purposes did not function in the Old Testament as they do
in the New. Every baptist who accepts the doctrine of election is compelled to
affirm as equally true that &ldquo;divine election cuts right across the
distinctions of&rdquo; baptism and unbaptism! Baptists believe that their
unbaptized infants who die are in fact elect. They also often assert that new
converts who die before their baptism are also elect. They also affirm that
some baptized people are not elect. So whatever this argument may establish, it
still does not set aside the fundamental fact that Baptist theology narrows the
scope of the grace of God in its historical manifestations inasmuch as it
excludes infants from an initiatory sign of promise that had always been theirs
in virtue of God&rsquo;s administration of the Abrahamic covenant.</p>


<p><a href="#_ftnref31" name="_ftn31" title="">[31]</a>
<em>Cf.</em> Calvin&rsquo;s powerful words in Gen. 17:14 where he treats the
subject of what punishment is due to those who <em>neglect</em> baptism.

<p><a href="#_ftnref32" name="_ftn32" title="">[32]</a>
<em>Cf.</em> Strong, <em>op. cit.</em>, pp. 536&ndash;537. Strong remarks,
&ldquo;As the national Israel typified the Spiritual Israel, so the
circumcision which immediately followed, not preceded, natural birth, bids us
baptize children, not before, but after spiritual birth.&rdquo; And again he
says, &ldquo;The Christian church is either a natural, hereditary body, or it
was merely typified by the Jewish people. In the former case, baptism belongs
to all children of Christian parents, and the church is indistinguishable from
the world. In the latter case, it belongs only to spiritual descendants, and
therefore only to true believers.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref33" name="_ftn33" title="">[33]</a>
Calvin points out that the Anabaptist assertion that a covenant cannot take
place without mental awareness is disproved by the Noahic covenant where God
covenants with &ldquo;brute animals&rdquo; in Gen. 9:10.</p>
